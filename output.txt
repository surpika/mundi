McRae, CC, ONZM, FRSC, a national of Canada and New Zealand, as arbitrator. Since the Parties did not agree on the method of constitution of the Tribunal until 18 June 2020, ICSID proceeded to seek Mr Fortier\'s and Professor McRae\'s acceptance of their appointments on 18 June 2020, in accordance with [Rule 5(2) of the 2006 ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the "**ICSID Arbitration Rules**](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/V0JyUlJFRDBRNmdVZmxOOVNneG1rK09yUXE5bkptR0FmTjNNeVo4OGdBRHdkRTlRYnIvNUx1eFN1WCtWaWFoc2N3WGVxRjJOUmkzM1ZsVGNmWE9wb2YyaHcySnU4azJVSlhZWkpxR0lvbU09)").

In accordance with their agreement, the Parties notified ICSID of their respective rankings on 30 and 31 July 2020.\n\n[]()\n\n11\\.\n\nOn 31 July 2020, ICSID informed the Parties that the co-arbitrators would jointly approach Sir Christopher Greenwood GBE, CMG, KC, a national of the United Kingdom and the highest-ranked candidate on the shortlists submitted by the Parties, with a view to confirming his availability to act as presiding arbitrator. On 5 August 2020, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr Fortier and Professor McRae had confirmed Sir Christopher\'s availability and willingness to act as presiding arbitrator in this case.

PO 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, French Republic.

The Tribunal rejected the Claimants\' request to address bifurcation as a preliminary question, before the submission of the Claimants\' Memorial on the Merits, as it found the request premature. The Tribunal likewise deferred its ruling on the Claimants\' request that there be a round of requests for document production in case of bifurcation if and when bifurcation is ordered.\n\n[]()\n\n16\\.\n\nAs part of the "Other Matters", the Claimants sought a ruling to allow Mr Kirill Levanidov, a cousin and business partner of the First Claimant, to attend the hearing prior to testifying as a witness, as an exception to the general rule that all witnesses will be sequestrated before their own testimony. The Tribunal rejected the Claimants\' request as it had "*difficulty seeing how his presence in the hearing room could be necessary to enable counsel for the Claimants to receive instructions*". In addition, the Tribunal expanded on the reasoning of its ruling in Section 23 of PO 1 on what constitutes confidential information and how confidential information should be treated.\n\n[]()\n\n17\\.\n\nIn accordance with Section 23.9 of PO 1, on 20 October 2020, ICSID proposed to the Parties to publish on its website by 2 November 2020 the Request for Arbitration, PO 1 and the Tribunal\'s Decision on Bifurcation and Other Matters.\n\n[]()\n\n18\\.\n\nOn 27 October 2020, the Claimants transmitted a redacted version of the Request for Arbitration for publication and indicated that they had received no objections to the redactions by the Respondent. The Claimants also stated that PO 1 and the Decision on Bifurcation and Other Matters contained no confidential information and could therefore be published in full. Having received no objection from the Respondent to publication of the documents, as redacted, ICSID posted them on its website on 2 November 2020.\n\n[]()\n\n19\\.\n\nOn 5 November 2020, the Respondent objected to the Claimants\' redactions to the Request for Arbitration based on the need for transparency given the public interest and the Claimants\' alleged failure to demonstrate the redacted information constituted business confidential information. At the invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimants replied on 19 November 2020, together with Exhibits C-0130 through C-0145 and Legal Authorities CL-0042 through CL-0059. The Respondent then responded on 24 November 2020, together with Exhibits R-0001 and R-0002, and on 26 November 2020, the Claimants filed their final comments, together with Exhibits C-0146 through C-0149.\n\n[]()\n\n20\\.\n\nOn 9 November 2020, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, attaching Exhibit C-0129, informing that Mr Levanidov (see above paragraph 16) had formally accepted an invitation to join the Board of North Star; this development, the Claimants argued would now "*confirm* \\[Mr Levanidov\'s] *qualification as an officer of a party whose presence at hearings is necessary to enable instructions to be given to counsel*". At the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent replied on 12 November 2020. The Tribunal took note of the Parties\' positions on the issue by email of later that same date.\n\n[]()\n\n21\\.\n\nOn 21 December 2020, the Tribunal issued [Procedural Order No. 2](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/SDg1M1hkb1F2RDhoYTBhejVrQ2JoQk9YQ3ozK2ZhV3J6WUZYaG4xNVBaSFpodTNsMndUK21qT0UrQ3B4M2pLQmphcFliNDRzbklLK3h3b1MzRmFOZG1ISjBoUEZyZVUxVDBGLzF0bUhma0dzWGwwQTdrUGk4aHBpY1BQM3U5UENwNFp4YkgzRkt1OXFkYmNNNVgxM1FubGxPSVZNbmUrRHpiM0Z2RG9ET3NpOTNlbWgxUWlXVlMzYyt1c0VPNTRmRkZYSzRrNkl5YlpPRTRJWm5BaCtWdz09) ("**PO 2**") concerning the publication of the Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal ruled that certain of the Claimants\' redactions be removed and a revised redacted version of the Request for Arbitration was published. Following further exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal, on 7 January 2021, the Claimants wrote to propose additional redactions to those ordered by the Tribunal in PO 2; with their request, the Claimants attached Exhibit C-0150.\n\n[]()\n\n22\\.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable in PO 1, on 12 March 2021, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits dated 11 March 2021 (the "Claimants\' **Memorial**"), together with Exhibits C-0151 through C-0182 and Legal Authorities CL-0060 through CL-0363; a Witness Statement of Mr Geir Knutsen ("**Knutsen WS**"); a Witness Statement of Mr Kirill Levanidov ("**Levanidov WS1**"), with Exhibits KL-0001 through KL-0052; a Witness Statement of Mr Peteris Pildegovics ("**Pildegovics WS1**"), with Exhibits PP-0001 through PP-0221; an Expert Report of Dr Anders Ryssdal ("**Ryssdal ER1**"), with Exhibits AR-0001 through AR-0023; an Expert Report of Dr Brooks Kaiser ("**Kaiser ER1**"), with Exhibits BK-0001 through BK-0055; and an Expert Report of Mr Kiran Sequeira, MBA, PE ("**Sequiera ER**"), with Exhibits VP-0001 through VP-0103.\n\n[]()\n\n23\\.\n\nOn 8 April 2021, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation (the "**Request for Bifurcation**"), together with Exhibits R-0001 through R-0003 and Legal Authorities RL-0001 and RL-0002. The Respondent requested to address the quantum stage in a separate phase of the proceeding.\n\n[]()\n\n24\\.\n\nOn 6 May 2021, the Claimants submitted their observations on the Request for Bifurcation, together with Exhibit C-0183 and Legal Authorities CL-0364 through CL-0393.\n\n[]()\n\n25\\.\n\nOn 1 June 2021, the Tribunal issued [Procedural Order No. 3](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/NmRXTkxNZVZVbXlhSURkaXBuZkpsTnJrUU9NL3laQlg2ZHZiREZSeUFVcmJXYnZFMGc1Tm1TdERieTVRWmY1cGxvZEdka2NzYlVicG84S2hKcHp0aktyU01Uai9NaXcxMGhaTkh2MHFTMmdlVDhYQ1NWTmphOGgzT1hYZ3lyKzA0a0c5YUMvbm5SZXJPZ0R2UHVOR3ZlTzhHOTd5dmJUU1Z0MUVsL2FPc3p5ZWpNcUlHTmhDUUlkU2ZVVFBYdG80L1l0cDNUZWtQdVdZOEVPcWp4WFBrKzJFdEM3aWJuRWJoNHhRckhIU1dyND0=) ("**PO 3**") concerning the Request for Bifurcation.

The Claimants stated that they were unaware that either Wikborg Rein or KPMG AS had performed work for Norway in connection with the present case until they received the Respondent\'s Statement of Costs dated 2 December 2022. The Claimants alleged these two professional services firms have had, or were likely to have had, access to confidential information regarding one or more of the Claimants. The Claimants also referred to what they described as an earlier conflict of interest arising out of Norway\'s use of the Latvian office of the Glimstedt Law Firm ("**Glimstedt**") while Glimstedt\'s Lithuanian office had represented the Claimants in an earlier stage of this arbitration. However, the Claimants noted that Glimstedt had withdrawn from advising Norway in this case when they had been alerted to the conflict by the Claimants.

The Tribunal noted that, given the Respondent\'s confirmation, no decision was required regarding Glimstedt. Regarding Wikborg Rein, the Tribunal rejected the Claimants\' request. Regarding the KPMG network, and in particular KPMG AS, it granted the Claimants\' request and directed the Respondent not to make any further use of those entities in the present arbitration.\n\n[]()\n\n65\\.\n\nFollowing the Respondent\'s clarification on 9 March 2023 of its position regarding certain corrections to the transcript as proposed by the Claimants, the Tribunal accepted the corrections as agreed between the Parties.\n\n[]()\n\n66\\.\n\nOn 17 March 2023, the Claimants (i) requested that the Tribunal "*ask Norway to clarify Wikborg Rein\'s status in the present case*"; and (ii) in reference to the Termination Agreement between Latvia and Norway (see above paragraph 40) set to enter into force on 27 March 2023, inquired whether the Tribunal could "*invite Norway to clarify its position and/or provide the diplomatic note of Latvia transmitting the notice of termination of the BIT, if possible*". Upon invitation from the Tribunal, the Respondent responded to both points. On 23 March 2023, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the law firms and additional persons, including those affiliated with Wikborg Rein, who are or have been assisting it in the present case. On 24 March 2023, the Respondent stated that it did not find it "*appropriate to submit the Latvian note*" due to its classification as "*limited access information*" under Latvian law; however, it did confirm that the Termination Agreement will enter into force on 27 March 2023.\n\n[]()\n\n67\\.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, the Tribunal acknowledged the Parties\' correspondence of 17, 23 and 24 March and stated that it did not consider any further action on its part to be appropriate at this stage.\n\n[]()\n\n68\\.\n\nOn 16 October 2023, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to inform it "*of a recent Note Verbale from the EU to Norway*" concerning a Norway Supreme Court decision to deny North star Svalbard fishing licences. The Claimants stated that they had only obtained a draft of the note and could not "*confirm whether it has been formally sent to Norway at this time*". With their correspondence, the Claimants submitted Exhibits C-0357 through C-0359. Upon invitation from the Tribunal, the Respondent provided its observations on 23 October 2023, therein (i) objecting to the Claimants\' submission of additional documents without requesting leave from the Tribunal pursuant to Section 16.3 of PO 1, and (ii) stating that the "*\'draft Note Verbale\' seems to be an internal document* \\[…] *and should not be shared*".\n\n[]()\n\n69\\.\n\nOn 1 November 2023, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to make a formal application, by 7 November 2023, for admission to the record of the exhibits submitted with its 16 October correspondence; the Respondent would then be permitted to respond by 15 November 2023. The Parties complied with the Tribunal\'s instructions.\n\n[]()\n\n70\\.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that it should admit the documents in order to ensure that it has the fullest possible picture of what happened. Accordingly, on 5 December 2023, the Tribunal agreed to admit the documents as C-0357 to C-0359. In doing so, the Tribunal noted, however, that the application to submit these documents was made at a very late stage of the proceedings, when the Claimants had already contacted the Tribunal to inquire when the Tribunal would give its ruling. That is both highly unusual and not conducive to the orderly conduct of the arbitration. Moreover, since the Judgment of the Supreme Court and the article critical of that Judgment had been public since late March 2023, it was not even a timely application. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is conscious of the importance of the present case and the fact that other arbitrations have been stayed pending its ruling.\n\n[]()\n\n71\\.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 22 December 2023.\n\n[]()\n\n## **II.

It is bounded by the Norwegian and Russian mainland to the south, the Svalbard archipelago to the north-west, and the Russian islands of Novaya Zemla and Franz Josef Land to the east and north-east. The relevant part of the Barents Sea is divided as follows:1\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//61cf1c53c18c94a95babc26a6b339b70e58edc24.png)\n\n(i) Norwegian waters, namely the territorial sea and the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone;\n\n(ii) Russian Federation waters, namely territorial sea and the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone;\n\n(iii) the waters pertaining to the islands of Svalbard, namely the territorial sea and the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone; and\n\n(iv) an area known as the "Loop Hole" (in Norwegian, the "*Smutthullet*").\n\nClaimants\' Opening Presentation: Facts, slide 6.\n\n[]()\n\n74\\.\n\nThe Loop Hole, an area of 78,220 square kilometres, is located more than 200 nautical miles from any point on the Norwegian or Russian coast and is therefore part of the High Seas.2\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//e813f4e84290588f5c8f759ac47bd1bd60f6addb.png)\n\n*See* Respondent\'s Opening Presentation, slide 5.\n\n[]()\n\n75\\.\n\nHowever, the seabed in the Loop Hole is divided between the extended continental shelf of Norway and that of the Russian Federation.3 In 2010 the two States agreed a maritime delimitation4 under which, according to Norway, approximately 89.19% of the seabed in the Loop Hole was attributed to the Russian Federation and the remaining 10.81% to Norway.5\n\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf has concluded that "*the entire area of the seabed and subsoil within the* Loophole *located beyond 200 M limits of Norway and the Russian Federation is part of the continental shelf of these coastal States*" (Summary of the Recommendations of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in regard to the Submission made by Norway in respect of Areas in the Arctic Ocean, the Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea on 27 November 2006, adopted 2009 (**C-0072**), para. 21).\n\nTreaty between the Kingdom of Norway and the Russian Federation concerning Maritime Delimitation and Cooperation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean, 2010 (**RL-0004** (Norwegian), **CL-0015** (English)).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 157, lines 19-23 (Mr Jervell).

Snow Crab in the Barents Sea**\n\n[]()\n\n81\\.\n\nSnow crab (*chionoecetes opilio*) is a migrating or invasive species,13 not native to the Barents Sea. It is unclear how it came to be introduced into the Barents Sea. The first reports of snow crab being caught in the Barents Sea date from 1996 (on the Russian continental shelf) and 2003 (on the Norwegian continental shelf) but very few crabs were caught until 2012, when the commercial possibilities of harvesting snow crab became apparent.

The table in the text is a simplified presentation of the data on landings only.\n\n[]()\n\n82\\.\n\nIt appears that, during the period covered by this table, the population density of snow crab was much higher in the Russian continental shelf than in the other parts of the Barents Sea.15 In particular, the snow crab in the Loop Hole were heavily concentrated on the Russian side of the 2010 demarcation line. However, Dr Kaiser indicates that the population was spreading rapidly into other parts of the Barents Sea.16\n\nKaiser ER1, para. 23. See also Resp.

Regulation of Snow Crab Harvesting and Landing by Norway and the Russian Federation**\n\n[]()\n\n84\\.\n\nIt is common ground that the catching of snow crab in the Loop Hole was originally unregulated by Norway, although a vessel seeking to catch snow crab in the Loop Hole would have to be registered with the NEAFC.19 In July 2014, in response to an inquiry regarding whether vessels registered in the European Union (the "**EU**") could land snow crab caught in the NEAFC area at Norwegian ports, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries wrote:\n\n*1. In principle, EU vessels can land fish, including snow crab to Norway on an equal footing with Norwegian fishing vessels. There are therefore no other rules for EU vessels when it comes to fresh and live goods. All registered buyers in Finnmark* \\[the region in northern Norway where Båtsfjord is located] *have a good overview of the conditions for landing.*\n\n*2.

The terms shall apply to conditions such as reporting of catches and positions, area, period restrictions and the like.*\n\n*Applications for an exemption are sent to the Directorate of Fisheries.*\n\n*Vessels that have fished snow crab in 2014 can continue catching after 1 January 2015, but must apply for an exemption by 15 February 2015.*\n\nJ-280-2014 (**C-0104**).\n\nAct Relating to the Management of Wild Living Marine Resources, 2008 (**CL-0012**).\n\n[]()\n\n86\\.\n\nOn 17 July 2015, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation and the Minister of Fisheries of the Kingdom of Norway held a meeting in Malta, in the context of the regular meeting of the Joint Fisheries Commission established by the two States. The minutes of this meeting (the "**Agreed Minutes**" or the "**Malta Declaration**") record that they agreed as follows:\n\n*In accordance with [Article 77 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982 (UNCLOS)](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTJna0pLS3JjUkh2S2NMUGNKSys1MlN3PT0=), the two Coastal States, the Russian Federation and Norway, exercise their sovereign rights in respect of the continental shelf of the Barents Sea for its exploration and development of its natural resources.*\n\n*Therefore, only these two Coastal States have the exclusive rights to harvest sedentary species on the continental shelf of the Barents Sea.*\n\n*Pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 77 of the Convention, both the Russian Federation and Norway will proceed from the fact that harvesting of sedentary species, including snow crab, in the NEAFC Regulatory Area in the Barents Sea shall not be carried out without the express assent of the Coastal State*.23 \\[emphasis added]\n\nMinutes of the Meeting between Ilya V. Shestakov, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation – Head of the Federal Agency for Fisheries, and Elisabeth Aspaker, Minister of Fisheries of the Kingdom of Norway, 17 July 2015 ("**Malta Declaration**") (**C-0106**).\n\n[]()\n\n87\\.\n\nThe significance of whether snow crab are sedentary or non-sedentary is that non-sedentary species are subject to the jurisdiction of a Coastal State only within its territorial waters and EEZ. Since the Loop Hole falls outside the EEZs of Norway and the Russian Federation, if snow crab are non-sedentary then neither State would have rights in respect of the snow crab stock in the Loop Hole. If, on the other hand, snow crab are a sedentary species, then the stock in the Loop Hole would fall within the continental shelf jurisdiction of either Norway or the Russian Federation.\n\n[]()\n\n88\\.\n\n[Article 77(4) of UNCLOS](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTI0Y21mS1ovVWZ5czMxb1phYzZJbExnPT0=) defines a sedentary species as "*organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil*".24\n\n**CL-0013**.\n\n[]()\n\n89\\.\n\nThe decision of the two governments that snow crab was a sedentary species within the meaning of Article 77(4) of UNCLOS is the subject of much criticism by the Claimants, who maintain that it represented a radical change of position by Norway, which they say had always treated snow crab as non-sedentary and therefore as falling outside the continental shelf jurisdiction. They maintain that the effect of this change of position was that, in the words of a working group of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, "\\[t]*he snow crab stock in the Loop Hole area then shifted from being in international waters to become Russian and Norwegian property on their continental shelves*".25 The Tribunal will return to this issue later in its Award. For the present, it is sufficient to note the agreement between Norway and the Russian Federation.\n\nICES, Report of the Working Group on the Integrated Assessments of the Barents Sea (**BK-0045**), p. 128.\n\n[]()\n\n90\\.\n\nThat agreement was followed by a change in Norwegian regulation of the harvesting and landing of snow crab. On 22 December 2015, Norway amended the 2014 Regulations with immediate effect. The new Regulations on the Prohibition of Catching Snow Crabs (the "**2015 Regulations**")26 amended Section 1 of the 2014 Regulations to read as follows:\n\n*It is prohibited for Norwegian and foreign vessels to catch snow crabs in the Norwegian territorial see* \\[*sic*] *(norsk sjøterritorium) and inland waters, and on the Norwegian continental shelf. For Norwegian vessels the prohibition also applies to other countries\' continental shelf*.\n\nSection 2 of the 2014 Regulations was amended as follows:\n\n*Application for an exemption is sent to the Directorate of Fisheries. The Directorate of Fisheries may impose restrictions on the number of vessels granted exemption for catching on the Russian continental shelf in the area outside 200 nautical miles of the Russian coast in the Barents Sea.*\n\nThe 2015 Regulations added a new Section 3:\n\n*§ 3 Catching from Russian Vessels*\n\n*Notwithstanding the prohibition in § 1, Russian vessels may catch snow crabs on the Norwegian Continental shelf in the area outside 200 nautical miles of the Norwegian coast in the Barents Sea.*\n\nJ-298-2015 (**C-0110**).\n\n[]()\n\n91\\.\n\nThe 2015 Regulations did not address the catching of snow crab by non-Norwegian vessels on the Russian continental shelf. That remained lawful under Russian law until September 2016. Under Norwegian law there was no prohibition on non-Norwegian vessels landing in Norway snow crab lawfully harvested outside Norwegian waters and the Norwegian continental shelf.27 In September 2016, the Russian Federation introduced a ban on foreign fishing vessels harvesting snow crab on the Russian continental shelf.28 Since snow crab taken on the Russian continental shelf in the Loop Hole by foreign vessels after 4 September 2016 was taken in breach of Russian law, from that point such takings could not lawfully be landed in Norway.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 155, line 24 to p. 156, line 1 (Mr Jervell).\n\nResp.

The Claimants\' Activities**\n\n[]()\n\n93\\.\n\nIn 2009, Mr Kirill Levanidov, a United States national, cousin and business partner of the First Claimant and later a director of the Second Claimant, took steps to establish a seafood business in Båtsfjord.32 He began performing consultancy services for the Norwegian fishing company Båtsfjord Fangst AS. The plan was initially to harvest red king crab, another species which had become established in the Barents Sea. Båtsfjord Fangst acquired a fishing vessel, the *Havnefjell*, which was registered in Norway33 and started catching crab in October 2009. In August 2009, Mr Levanidov founded another Norwegian company, Ishavsbruket AS, later renamed Seagourmet Norway AS ("**Seagourmet**", the name by which it will be referred to in this Award). In 2010, Seagourmet began to construct a factory in Båtsfjord for storing and processing crab. That facility was built up extensively over the next six years.34\n\nLevanidov WS1 and WS2; Transcript, Day 1, p. 36, line 8 to p. 51, line 12 (Mr Laporte).\n\nCertificate of Nationality for *Havnefjell*, 8 September 2009 (**KL-0005**).\n\nLevanidov WS1, paras. 10-15.\n\n[]()\n\n94\\.\n\nThere is considerable evidence that the Seagourmet processing facility had a significant effect upon the economy of Båtsfjord, employing some 60 people (3% of the workforce of the town). Its positive effects on Båtsfjord are confirmed by the testimony of Mr Geir Knutsen, the Mayor of Båtsfjord, in his Witness Statement and his examination before the Tribunal.35\n\nTranscript, Day 3, p. 31, line 11 to p. 41, line 7 (Mr Knutsen).\n\n[]()\n\n95\\.\n\nIn May 2010, Mr Levanidov met his cousin, the First Claimant, to discuss financing for the business, which he described, in an email to Mr Pildegovics,36 as an integrated business for harvesting, processing and selling crab. Although the initial plan was for red king crab, Mr Levanidov subsequently became aware of the presence of snow crab in the Barents Sea and the possibilities for commercial exploitation which that offered. Mr Levanidov\'s colleague, Mr Ankipov, inquired about regulation of snow crab fishing and received the reply that "\\[c]*atching of snow crab is unregulated. Norwegian fishing vessels* \\[…] *can fish for this species in* \\[the Norwegian EEZ and the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone]*. If Norwegian vessels are to catch snow crab in international waters, they must be registered for fishing in the NEAFC area*".37 On 5 July 2013, the *Havnefjell* was registered for snow crab fishing in the NEAFC area (*i.e.* the Loop Hole) and caught 1.4 tonnes of snow crab in 2013 and 4.6 tonnes in 2014. These catches were disappointing and Mr Levanidov decided to look for other ways of supplying Seagourmet\'s Båtsfjord factory.38\n\nEmail from Mr Levanidov to Mr Pildegovics, 14 May 2010 (**PP-0009A**).\n\nLevanidov WS1, para. 23; Email from Mr Sigmund Hågensen of the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries to Mr Sergei Ankipov, 16 May 2013 (**KL-0016**).\n\nLevanidov WS1, paras. 26-27.\n\n[]()\n\n96\\.\n\nMr Levanidov and his colleagues therefore inquired about the possibility of fishing vessels registered in the EU harvesting snow crab and landing it in Norway and received the reply that "*EU-registered fishing boats can deliver crab freely to Norwegian crab receptions*" but that the boats must have a quota if the fishing was quota-regulated.39 A later inquiry elicited the reply set out at paragraph 84, above. Mr Levanidov concluded from these exchanges that EU-registered fishing vessels could lawfully harvest snow crab in the Loop Hole and land their catches in Norway.40\n\nEmail exchanges between Mr Sergei Ankipov Mr Sofus Olsen of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, 3-5 February 2014 (**KL-0019**).\n\nLevanidov WS1, paras. 33-34.\n\n[]()\n\n97\\.\n\nMr Pildegovics therefore began to explore the possibility of using fishing vessels registered in Latvia to harvest snow crab in the Loop Hole. The Latvian Government inquired of the European Commission regarding "*snow crab fisheries in the NEAFC international waters*" adding that "*we presume that this is unregulated fisheries and after notification our vessels could start fisheries*".41 The Commission replied that "\\[y]*our presumption is correct. Snow crab/Opilio is un-regulated as far as NEAFC is concerned and you can start fishing once your vessel is notified*".42\n\nEmail from Mr Janis Laguns of the Latvian Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries Department to the European Commission, 19 August 2013 (**C-0089**).\n\nEmail from Ms Pernille Skov Jensen of the European Commission to Mr Janis Laguns of the Latvian Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries Department, 30 September 2013 (**C-0090**).\n\n[]()\n\n98\\.\n\nIn January 2014, Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov met in Riga and agreed to implement the concept of an integrated snow crab harvesting and processing business. They describe the outcome of the meeting as the creation of a joint venture between them, in which Mr Pildegovics would build a fishing enterprise to harvest and land snow crab, while Mr Levanidov would build capacity to process the crab in Båtsfjord.43 The agreement which they say they reached was oral.44 The Tribunal will return (see paragraphs 238-248, below) to the evidence regarding this joint venture agreement and the implications for the present case.\n\nLevanidov WS1, paras. 34-41; Pildegovics WS1, paras. 29-43.\n\nLevanidov WS2, paras. 38-39; Pildegovics WS1, para. 31.\n\n[]()\n\n99\\.\n\nMr Pildegovics arranged the incorporation of North Star in Latvia in February 2014.

But this clearly does not oblige Norway or other Contracting Parties to continue to accept such catching without the coastal State\'s consent. In 2015, moreover, Norway, Russia and the EU expressed that the coastal States, as set out in the rules I have reviewed, have a right alone to exploit the snow crab on their respective continental shelves.* \\[…]\n\n*On these grounds, I have concluded that Norway is not bound by any obligation under international law to accept catching of snow crab in the Loop Hole from a Lithuanian vessel without a Norwegian permit.

Both parties were also aware that fishing and catching without a valid permit were criminal offences pursuant to Norwegian legislation*.89\n\n*Rafael Uzakov and SIA North Star v.

The procedure followed by the Supreme Court is an important feature of the Claimants\' case that they suffered a denial of justice and will be considered in that context. For now, it is sufficient to note that, in its Judgment of 14 February 2019,90 the Court ruled (in the judgment of Justice Berglund, with whom the other members of the Grand Chamber agreed):\n\n*(66) The* \\[Svalbard] *Treaty establishes that Norway is to manage the natural resources and assumes that the High Contracting Parties comply with the rules that are implemented to fulfil this task. It is therefore clear that the Treaty gives Norway a right to enforce a regulatory system under which unauthorised catching is punishable, as long as such a system is practised in a non-discriminatory manner* \\[…].\n\n*(67) As it appears from the legal framework I have described, a management system has been established by the Snow Crab Regulations under which a permit is required for anyone who wishes to catch snow crab. Unauthorised catching is punishable, regardless of nationality. No one has a legal right to a permit. To obtain an exemption, various requirements must be met, and the wording of the provision suggests that the granting of such an exemption is left to the authorities\' discretion. I add that even if one meets the basic requirements for a commercial licence, which is necessary to attain a permit to catch snow crab, such a permit is not automatically issued. Previous violation of fishery legislation may, for instance, form a basis for refusal.*\n\n\\[…]\n\n*(80) As I see it, it cannot be derived from the Svalbard Treaty or other sources of international law that the courts in a criminal case like the one at hand must decide on a preliminary basis whether an exemption should have been granted, as long as there is an alternative legal possibility to obtain an efficient review of the disagreement on the obligations under international law. If there are several acceptable procedures, it must be up to the individual country to decide which procedure to employ. Under Norwegian law, an issue of conflict between Norwegian public administration and international obligations should be solved through a civil action. This is not an unreasonable system. If the party succeeds with a civil claim, the party may – if the general conditions are otherwise met – demand compensation for economic loss and coverage of costs. A civil judgment declaring a regulation invalid will also give Norwegian authorities the possibility to amend the rules in accordance with international law while at the same time taking into account other concerns, such as protection of natural resources.*\n\n\\[…]\n\n*(83) Consequently, I agree with the court of appeal that the defendants can be punished irrespective of whether the Svalbard Treaty applies to snow crab catching in the relevant area. Furthermore, it is irrelevant whether the basis for exemption in section 2 of the Snow Crab Regulations is in conflict with the Treaty. What ultimately justifies punishment of the defendants is that Svalbard Treaty\'s principle of equal rights has not in any case been violated, since everyone – also Norwegian citizens and companies – can be punished for catching snow crab in the area without a permit from Norwegian fishery authorities. The defendants did not hold such a permit.*91\n\n*SIA North Star v.

In a judgment of 20 March 2023, delivered by Justice Ringnes with whom the other fourteen justices concurred, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and concluded that\n\n*the shipping company does not have a right to catch snow crab on the continental shelf outside Svalbard. This follows from the equal rights of the nationals and ships of the High Contracting Parties to fish and hunt under Article 2 of the Svalbard Treaty being geographically limited to Svalbard\'s internal waters and territorial sea. Nor may Article 1 or Article 3 be interpreted to mean that a right of equality applies to the continental outside off Svalbard.

Dr Ryssdal\'s conclusion that the performance of the contract took place in Norwegian territory is based on the claims in Mr Pildegovics\'s Witness Statement.160 The Respondent emphasizes that the obligations of the joint venture are unclear and so is their place of performance.

It claims not a single vessel caught more than 0.27% of its total catch of snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf. Overall, 99.84% of the total catch of snow crab was caught outside the Norwegian continental shelf.186 The Respondent concludes that Latvian-flagged vessels that were able to operate anywhere—and were in fact harvesting snow crab on the Russian continental shelf for over 99% of their harvesting operations—cannot be investments "*in the territory*" of Norway.187\n\nResp.

The "*fishing capacity*" only made North Star eligible to apply for such rights (and other fishing rights) as a matter of EU law.191 The Respondent further asserts that the Claimants have not alleged anything that impinges on this right conferred by the Latvian government.192\n\nResp.

It submits that a contract for the delivery of an asset to Norway cannot in itself be considered a qualifying investment in the territory of Norway, in particular since neither the sellers nor their ships were located in Norway.197 Further, even if the two ships had been delivered, as with North Star\'s other fishing vessels, they would not have been used in Norwegian territory but on the high seas and in Russian territory.198\n\nResp.

The Claimants allege the contracts were concluded in Båtsfjord, Norway, though the Respondent argues that this cannot be indicative of whether a particular clause in the contract gives a right to performance in Norway.202 The particular claim to performance relied upon by the Claimants is the claim to payment, which according to the Respondent would have been made, if at all, into North Star\'s Latvian bank account. The Respondent further argues that the fact that the delivery of snow crab took place in Seagourmet\'s factory in Norway is the wrong focus. It submits that whether North Star has claims to performance as against Seagourmet cannot be determined by the place where North Star\'s own obligations to Seagourmet would be performed.203 Finally, the Respondent asserts the contracts are void as a matter of Latvian law to the extent they envisaged action in breach of Norwegian law.204\n\nResp.

Moreover, the BIT\'s definition includes "*any kind of asset*" and Mr Pildegovics\' contractual rights under the joint venture are properly characterized as "*claims to performance under contract having an economic value*".260 The Claimants allege their assets were moreover acquired to form a single business with a common economic purpose. The Claimants explain their economic operations as follows.\n\n(a) By entering into a joint venture agreement with Mr Levanidov, the owner of Seagourmet, Mr Pildegovics secured a dedicated source of demand for his snow crab catches as well as key operational benefits tied to the close coordination between supplier (North Star) and customer (Seagourmet).261\n\n(b) Through his sole shareholding in North Star, Mr Pildegovics controlled a fishing company with the capacity to catch and deliver the snow crab supplies required by Seagourmet and other customers related to the joint venture. North Star was the main operational arm of Mr Pildegovics\' snow crab fishing business, and the main conduit through which he fulfilled his commitments under the joint venture with Mr Levanidov.262\n\n(c) Through his sole shareholding in Sea &amp; Coast, Mr Pildegovics controlled a Norwegian local agency which served as his investment\'s procurement arm, supporting North Star\'s vessel\'s by ensuring their supply of needed goods and services through sourcing in the local community.263\n\n(d) North Star\'s vessels, fitted and equipped for snow crab fishing in the Barents Sea, gave the company the material means to catch and deliver large quantities of snow crabs to Seagourmet and other customers of the joint venture—North Star\'s *raison d\'être*. North Star\'s fishing capacity rights enabled its ships to operate as fishing vessels for this purpose.264\n\n(e) North Star\'s fishing licences gave the company the legal right to engage in snow crab fishing in the Barents Sea, first in the international waters of the NEAFC area (from 1 July 2014) and later in waters off the Svalbard archipelago (from 1 November 2016), fishing grounds with a large and growing snow crab population.265\n\n(f) North Star\'s contracts for the purchase of additional vessels (*Sokol* and *Solyaris*) were concluded to enable the company to expand its fishing capacity, in response to growing demand, including Seagourmet\'s increased absorption capability. The vessels were already operating in the Barents Sea snow crab fishery, were suited to the needs of the joint venture, and were available for delivery to the port of Båtsfjord. North Star also acquired fishing capacity rights to allow these ships to operate as fishing vessels under the Latvian flag.266\n\n(g) Finally, North Star concluded supply agreements to formalize the terms of its snow crab sales to Seagourmet and other seafood distributors linked to the joint venture.267\n\nCl.

This meant that every fishing trip started and ended in Båtsfjord, and the ships were berthed there between trips. The Claimants\' business consisted fundamentally in bringing a resource (snow crab) to Norway.294\n\n(c) North Star\'s vessels were serviced by a Norwegian company owned by Mr Pildegovics, Sea &amp; Coast, based in the port of Båtsfjord, which served as its local agent "*in ports of call and on fishing ground in Norway*".295\n\n(d) At its operational peak in 2016, North Star employed over ninety seafarers and administrative staff who were based in or operated from Båtsfjord. This compared to no more than four employees at the company\'s headquarters in Riga.296\n\n(e) Mr Pildegovics and his joint venture partner Mr Levanidov met at the venture\'s Båtsfjord premises at least twenty times over a period of seven years.297\n\n(f) Mr Pildegovics\' claims arising from the joint venture agreement pertained to Mr Levanidov\'s performance in Norway: chiefly to build capacity to process North Star\'s snow crab catches at Seagourmet\'s factory in the port of Båtsfjord, and to purchase large supplies of snow crabs to be delivered there by North Star.298\n\nCl.

The first objection is that the real dispute is between Norway, the EU and other States and concerns not the rules of investment protection but quite different bodies of international law, in particular UNCLOS and the Svalbard Treaty, which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to apply. Moreover, if the Tribunal were to try to apply those instruments, it would inevitably be required to determine the legality of the acts of other States not party to the case.\n\n[]()\n\n234\\.\n\nThe Respondent\'s second objection is that neither Claimant has made an investment in the territory of Norway to which its claim relates. According to Norway, the real investor is Mr Levanidov who, as a national of the United States, may not bring a claim under the Latvia-Norway BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n235\\.\n\nWhile the Tribunal notes the order in which the Respondent has presented its objections, it considers that it is more appropriate to begin by examining whether the Claimants have made an investment, as defined in the BIT, in the territory of Norway, and whether they have shown the existence of a dispute relating to, or arising directly out of, that investment. Only if the Tribunal considers that these fundamental jurisdictional requirements are satisfied, will it then be necessary to move on to a discussion of the Respondent\'s First Objection. Before addressing either Objection, however, the Tribunal will briefly consider the issue of the law applicable to the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n[]()\n\n## **(2) Applicable Law**\n\n[]()\n\n236\\.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties are in broad agreement on the issue of applicable law. The Tribunal concurs with their view that the applicable law is to be found in [Article 25 of the ICSID Convention](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/S2VVN09EOGhRRHg0SlZ3SS9qUjlwSUhxOWpSbTk0ZGxsOTFuVUV3TlRXRzdrWGQyOWVoOUU0WjNBM2sxaGo0NWZ1RWpXU01heVNtdmxZZGJZRnc1dFJFMHlTYlBrTzFZbHFsK1Q5aHljTlowZUFWeHp6d1NxU0JqVXlid0dDQUo2TFlxOXJvenRhU1lvRHdFSXdtclVZdWozWS81bXZUL2JnelpFa0krdzRFRjBOUmZiRzFmb2h4d0NjWVdyN2lmYkw4aWtCaHlnaXN1LzFxaytRVDllMjJjNkxzeUI0SlBTMTZ4ZVlyZUJBVT0=) and Article IX of the BIT, the provisions of which are to be interpreted in accordance with the rules of international law respecting treaty interpretation. Those rules are generally considered to have been codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969. While the Vienna Convention is not in force between Latvia and Norway, the rules and principles of treaty interpretation contained in Articles 31 to 33 are generally regarded as declaratory of customary international law and will therefore be applied as such.\n\n[]()\n\n237\\.\n\nWith regard to the difference between the Parties concerning the role of Norwegian law, Article I(1) of the BIT provides in relevant part:\n\n*The term "investment" shall mean every kind of asset invested in the territory of one Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations by an investor of the other Contracting Party* \\[…]*.*\n\n\\[emphasis added]\n\n[]()\n\n238\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the passage emphasised means that for an asset to qualify as an investment within the meaning of the BIT it must be made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State. Otherwise it is not an "investment" for the purposes of the BIT and a tribunal constituted under Article IX will not have jurisdiction over a dispute which arises out of it. In the view of the Tribunal, this requirement is satisfied if, at the time that the asset is first invested, it is invested in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State. If those laws and regulations subsequently change, that change will not deprive the asset of its quality as an investment within the meaning of the BIT. To hold otherwise would enable a host State to circumvent the protection of the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n## **(3) The Respondent\'s Second Objection**\n\n[]()\n\n239\\.\n\nThe Respondent\'s Second Objection is that the dispute does not relate to, or arise directly out of, an investment made by the Claimants in the territory of Norway. This objection requires determination of several different issues.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***a. The "Joint Venture"***\n\n[]()\n\n240\\.\n\nA threshold issue is the precise relationship between the two Claimants and Mr Levanidov and the companies owned and controlled by Mr Levanidov. Neither Mr Levanidov nor any of the companies which he owns and controls possess Latvian nationality, so none can be a claimant. The Claimants recognize that fact but maintain that Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov concluded in 2014 a joint venture agreement and that the joint venture, or at least the Claimants\' rights under that joint venture, is a central part of the investment in the present case. That claim goes to the heart of the relationship between the Claimants on the one hand and Mr Levanidov and his companies on the other and, in turn, to the identification of any investment on the part of the Claimants.\n\n[]()\n\n241\\.\n\nThere is a degree of ambiguity in the Claimants\' pleadings regarding this alleged joint venture. On the one hand, the Claimants maintain that their operations and those of Mr Levanidov and Seagourmet in Båtsfjord were "*an integrated economic enterprise*"335 and were in practice inseparable. The evidence of Mr Knutsen, the Mayor of Båtsfjord,336 lends some support to this view but his evidence is that, to an outside observer, the two men appeared and worked together. He could not testify as to the legal nature of the arrangements between them.\n\nPildegovics WS1, para. 42.\n\nKnutsen WS, para. 3; Transcript, Day 3, p. 32, line 23 to p. 33, line 2 (Mr Knutsen).\n\n[]()\n\n242\\.\n\nNevertheless, the Claimants, when talking about the effect of "*their*" investments on the economy of Norway and, in particular, of Båtsfjord, tend to treat Seagourmet\'s employment of local staff and the money which Seagourmet brought to Båtsfjord as though they were part of the Claimants\' investment.\n\n[]()\n\n243\\.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants make much of the fact that Mr Pildegovics worked for significant periods of time from the offices of Seagourmet in Båtsfjord, and that he and Mr Levanidov marketed the activities of Seagourmet and North Star together. They also testified that, during 2015 and 2016, Seagourmet was entirely dependent upon North Star for supplies of snow crab and that North Star supplied most of the snow crab which it harvested in the Loop Hole to Seagourmet (the remaining stock being sold to other processing facilities only because of the limits on the capacity of Seagourmet).\n\n[]()\n\n244\\.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants accept that the companies were separate entities and that there was, in 2014 to 2016, no arrangement for sharing of profits. They admit that Seagourmet invoiced North Star and Sea &amp; Coast for the office space occupied by Mr Pildegovics337 and that "\\[i]*t was decided, on the managerial level, that we don\'t want to mix operations of Seagourmet and operations of Sea &amp; Coast*".338 Mr Levanidov testified that the joint venture did not make either Seagourmet or Mr Levanidov personally liable for any award of costs which the Tribunal might make against the Claimants.339 Although they date from 2016 and 2017, the Tribunal has been shown agreements between North Star and Seagourmet (and \\[REDACTED]) for the supply of snow crab and the price to be paid.\n\nPildegovics WS1, para. 42(f): "*North Star and Sea &amp; Coast rented office space from Seagourmet*"; see also the invoice at **PP-0033**.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 67, lines 17-19 (Mr Pildegovics).\n\nTranscript, Day 3, p. 26, line 19 to p. 27, line 2 (Mr Levanidov).\n\n[]()\n\n245\\.\n\nThe Claimants describe the joint venture agreement as a purely oral agreement. The evidence of both Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov was that it was concluded by a handshake on the basis of mutual trust between two cousins. They accepted that there was no documentary proof of the existence or terms of the joint venture. The Claimants\' expert, Dr Ryssdal, stated that under Norwegian law purely oral agreements are recognized and enforceable. He considered that the joint venture existed and was governed by Norwegian law.\n\n[]()\n\n246\\.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the evidence of Dr Ryssdal that Norwegian law recognizes and will enforce a purely oral agreement. It notes that the Parties differ as to whether the oral agreement alleged by the Claimants would in fact have been governed by Norwegian law but considers that it is unnecessary to decide that question.\n\n[]()\n\n247\\.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the only evidence of the existence or contents of the supposed joint venture is the testimony of Mr Pildegovics, a party to these proceedings, and Mr Levanidov, a director of the second Claimant and someone intimately involved in the case though not himself a Party.340 The Tribunal considers it remarkable that during the two or more years that this joint venture is said to have operated there is apparently not a single document of any kind which confirms its existence, let alone its terms.341\n\nMr Knutsen\'s evidence goes to outside appearances and not the nature or content of any agreement between Mr Levanidov and Mr Pildegovics.\n\nThe Claimants assert that "*the record contains contemporaneous public documents presenting Mr Levanidov and Mr Pildegovics as partners dating back at least to early 2015, years before any hint of a potential investment dispute with Norway*" (Cl. Reply, para. 351). A footnote refers to the First Witness Statement of Mr Pildegovics, paras. 133-144, but while those passages certainly show that Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov worked closely together, they do not evidence a legally binding agreement or the contents which such an agreement might have had.\n\n[]()\n\n248\\.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the evidence of Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov establishes that the two of them agreed to co-operate in setting up an operation, designed to be "*seamless*", under which Mr Pildegovics\' company, North Star, would harvest snow crab and deliver it to Seagourmet\'s facility in Båtsfjord, where it would be processed and then marketed by Seagourmet. However, the record before the Tribunal is not sufficient to establish what rights Mr Pildegovics might have been able to claim under that oral agreement. While Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov spoke of the possibility of a sharing of profits at some undetermined time in the future342 and of one day establishing a holding company which would own both North Star and Seagourmet (and perhaps Sea &amp; Coast),343 none of this materialised. Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov seem to have treated these questions as matters to be resolved at some future stage.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 110, line 11 to p. 111, line 8 (Mr Pildegovics); Levanidov WS1, paras. 49-50.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 29, line 22 to p. 30, line 3 (Mr Pildegovics).\n\n[]()\n\n249\\.\n\nAlthough the BIT includes claims to performance under contract which have an economic value as an example of investment,344 there is no evidence of what, if any, performance Mr Pildegovics could have claimed under the supposed joint venture or what value it might have had. The evidence shows that North Star was paid by Seagourmet for the snow crab which it delivered to Seagourmet in 2015 and 2016 and that Seagourmet invoiced Sea &amp; Coast and North Star for the use of office space; in other words, the companies operated at arms\' length and not as though they were all part of a single venture. It also establishes that there was, as late as early 2017, no agreement regarding sharing profits beyond a vague thought that one day an agreement would be reached on that subject.\n\nBIT (**CL-0001**), Art. I(1)(iii).\n\n[]()\n\n250\\.\n\nIt follows that, in determining the focus of each Claimant\'s activities, their operations and those of Seagourmet and Mr Levanidov\'s other companies must be kept separate. The fact that Seagourmet\'s operations were based in Norway does not give the Claimants\' activities a Norwegian location. Whether or not they have such a location so that any investment they have is considered to be located in Norwegian territory must be decided without reference to the activities of Seagourmet and Mr Levanidov.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***b. The Claimants\' Alleged Investments***\n\n[]()\n\n251\\.\n\nThe Tribunal will, therefore, focus on what assets, owned either by Mr Pildegovics or by North Star, might qualify as an investment under the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(i) The definition of investment***\n\n[]()\n\n252\\.\n\nThe BIT defines investment in Article I:\n\n*For the purpose of the present Agreement:*\n\n*1. The term "investment" shall mean every kind of asset invested in the territory of one Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations by an investor of the other Contracting Party and shall mean in particular, though not exclusively:*\n\n*(i) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens, pledges and similar rights;*\n\n*(ii) shares, debentures or any other forms of participation in companies;*\n\n*(iii)claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance under contract having an economic value;*\n\n\\[…]\n\n*(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract and exploit natural resources;*\n\n\\[…]\n\n[]()\n\n253\\.\n\nArticle I(4) of the BIT provides that:\n\n*The term "territory" shall mean:*\n\n*The territory of the Kingdom of Norway and the territory of the Republic of Latvia, including the territorial sea, as well as the continental shelf over which the State concerned exercises, in accordance with international law, sovereign rights for the purpose of exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of such areas.*\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(ii) The First Claimant***\n\n[]()\n\n254\\.\n\nThe Tribunal has accepted that Mr Pildegovics had some kind of joint venture agreement with Mr Levanidov, although it has rejected most of his case regarding the content of that joint venture. The Second Claimant earned substantial revenues by delivering snow crab to Seagourmet in 2015 and the first eight months of 2016 but those revenues accrued to North Star and not to Mr Pildegovics, and North Star was not a party to the joint venture agreement (as Mr Levanidov made clear when discussing the possible liability for costs of the present proceeding). Even if Mr Pildegovics had a right, under his oral agreement with Mr Levanidov, to have Seagourmet accept and pay for the deliveries of crab, it was North Star which enjoyed any economic benefit.\n\n[]()\n\n255\\.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot see that reference to his 100% shareholding in North Star takes Mr Pildegovics anywhere. North Star is a Latvian company and a shareholding in that company is not, on the face of it, an investment in Norway. If North Star made an investment in Norway, then Mr Pildegovics could claim in respect of his indirect ownership thereof but his claim would not add anything to the claim being made by the company itself.\n\n[]()\n\n256\\.\n\nSea &amp; Coast is a different matter. That was a Norwegian company based in Norway and deriving its revenue from providing marine services in Norway. Mr Pildegovics acquired 100% of the shares in Sea &amp; Coast in October 2015. The Counter-Memorial states that "*Norway does not dispute that Mr Pildegovics\' ownership of Sea &amp; Coast falls within the definition of an \'investment\' in the BIT*"345 though it questions whether there is a dispute between Mr Pildegovics and Norway in relation to that shareholding.\n\nResp. Counter-Memorial, para. 467.\n\n[]()\n\n257\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Mr Pildegovics\' shareholding in Sea &amp; Coast was an investment in Norway. Article I(1)(ii) of the BIT provides that "*shares, debentures or any other forms of participation in companies*" are a form of investment. The company was located in Båtsfjord and its operations were conducted there. The Tribunal also concludes that there is a dispute between the Parties in relation to that investment in that Mr Pildegovics claims, and Norway denies, that Norway\'s actions resulted in Sea &amp; Coast\'s business drying up as North Star and its other customers ceased harvesting snow crab and thus no longer required the services of Sea &amp; Coast.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(iii) The Second Claimant***\n\n[]()\n\n258\\.\n\nNorth Star refers to the following as investments in Norway:-\n\n(i) the four fishing vessels: *Solvita, Senator*, *Saldus* and *Solveiga*;\n\n(ii) the fishing licences granted in respect of these four vessels by Latvia;\n\n(iii) the fishing capacity granted in respect of these four vessels;\n\n(iv) the contract to purchase the two further vessels; and\n\n(v) the right to payment from Seagourmet and the other processing facilities for snow crab to be provided by North Star.\n\n[]()\n\n259\\.\n\nNorth Star, however, urges the Tribunal to take an "*holistic*" view, looking at the operation as a whole, rather than considering individual parts. It contends that fishing is not in itself an economic activity but only the first step in a process which also involves processing and marketing.\n\n[]()\n\n260\\.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that there is often a strong case for a tribunal to look at the totality of a claimant\'s activities rather than at individual contracts.346 However, what has to be decided here is not just whether there was an investment but whether there was an investment *in Norway*.\n\nSee, e.g., C. Schreuer, "Article 25" in *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge University Press, 2009) (**CL-0060**), paras. 93-105.\n\n[]()\n\n261\\.\n\nNorth Star maintains that the chief economic locus of its operations was in Norwegian territory. The Tribunal accepts that it was in Norway (Båtsfjord) that North Star\'s vessels landed their catch between 2014 and September 2016 and sold it to Seagourmet and other processing facilities. The ships were also serviced by Sea &amp; Coast in Norway. However, the ships were all registered in Latvia and there is no evidence that any of them was purchased from an owner in Norway.347 Moreover, the project, as originally conceived and as explained in Mr Ankipov\'s inquiry to the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries, was that the ships would harvest crab outside Norwegian waters (see paragraph 101, above). The licences initially issued to North Star came from the Government of Latvia, not Norway, and authorized the harvesting of snow crab in international waters (see paragraph 104, above).\n\n*Solvita*, which was formerly Russian flagged, was delivered to North Star at Båtsfjord. *Senator* was delivered in Iceland and the other two vessels in South Korea: Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 480. See also paragraph 102, above, and the references in the footnotes to that paragraph.\n\n[]()\n\n262\\.\n\nAs explained above (see paragraphs 73 to 80), the entire seabed and subsoil of the Loop Hole is divided between the continental shelf of Norway and that of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the 2010 Delimitation Treaty. Article I(4) of the BIT defines the territory of Norway as including the continental shelf over which Norway exercises sovereign rights in accordance with international law. The effect of the 2010 Delimitation Treaty is that just under 11% of the Loop Hole falls within the Norwegian continental shelf, while the remaining 89% is part of the continental shelf of the Russian Federation.\n\n[]()\n\n263\\.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Claimants advanced an argument that, because Norwegian Government ships conducted inspections in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole, the entire continental shelf in the Loop Hole should be regarded as Norwegian territory for the purposes of Article I(4) of the BIT, on the basis that Norway exercised sovereign rights there.348 The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument (which the Claimants advanced only as an alternative). Norway and the Russian Federation shared certain policing responsibilities in the Loop Hole as part of a scheme for joint management of resources there but to the extent that one State exercised authority on the continental shelf of the other State, it did so only because it had the permission of the latter State to do so. It was not exercising its own sovereignty. Moreover, Article 2 of the 2010 Delimitation Agreement is quite explicit on this point:\n\n*Each Party shall abide by the maritime delimitation line as defined in Article 1 and shall not claim or exercise any sovereign rights or coastal State jurisdiction in maritime areas beyond this line*.349\n\nTranscript, Day 4, p. 18, line 10 to p. 20, line 17 (Mr Savoie); p. 27, line 14 to p. 28, line 17 (Mr Savoie) and p. 35, line 12 to p. 36, line 21 (Professor Miron).\n\n**CL-0015**.\n\n[]()\n\n264\\.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the only part of the Loop Hole which constitutes Norwegian territory for the purposes of the BIT is the 10.81% of the continental shelf which lies on the Norwegian side of the 2010 demarcation line. It is therefore necessary to consider where North Star\'s four vessels harvested snow crab.\n\n[]()\n\n265\\.\n\nAccording to Norway, which based its submission on reports350 provided by the Section of Analysis in Vardø, a Norwegian Government agency, 99.84% of the snow crab harvested by North Star\'s vessels up to 9 September 2016 was taken on the Russian continental shelf.351 The Claimants are highly critical of these reports on the basis that they are not the work of an independent expert who could be subjected to cross-examination.352 The Respondent replies that the Claimants have submitted no evidence of their own about the location of the harvesting and that the ships\' log books, which Mr Pildegovics testified would have shown that information,353 are not part of the record in the present case.\n\nSection of Analysis in Vardø, Guidance and Summary Reports Concerning Vessels Belonging to the Latvian Company SIA North Star, 28 October 2021 (**R-0151**); Section of Analysis in Vardø, Report on *Saldus*, 28 October 2021 (**R-0152**); Section of Analysis in Vardø, Report on *Senator*, 28 October 2021 (**R-0153**); Section of Analysis in Vardø, Report on *Solveiga*, 28 October 2021 (**R-0154**); Section of Analysis in Vardø, Report on *Solvita*, 28 October 2021 (**R-0155**).\n\nResp.

Moreover, they admit that the main harvesting activity took place on the Russian side of the 2010 delimitation line. When Mr Pildegovics gave evidence, the following exchange took place:\n\n*The President:* \\[…] \\[Y]*esterday, counsel for the Respondent said that, if I remember rightly, 98% of the snow crab harvested by your ships in 2015 and 2016 was taken from the Russian part of the Loop Hole, is that correct ?*\n\n\\[Mr Pildegovics]*: To the best of my knowledge, I would doubt the accuracy of this calculation, but I need to admit that so-called Russian part of NEAFC was the part where the majority of all catches by all flags were made, including Norwegian*.354\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 164, lines 15-23 (Mr Pildegovics).\n\n[]()\n\n267\\.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal is that North Star\'s four vessels took the great majority of their catch in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole, which was where the greatest concentration of snow crab was to be found at the relevant time.\n\n[]()\n\n268\\.\n\nIn urging the Tribunal to take an holistic approach, North Star cites the decisions of the tribunals in *SGS v. Pakistan*355 and *SGS v. Philippines*.356 SGS provided a comprehensive import supervision service (CISS) to the two respondent States. Although most of its work in inspecting goods due to be exported took place in the countries of origin, the operation as a whole was held to be an investment in the respondent States. As the tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* put it:\n\n*Under the CISS agreement, SGS was to provide services, within and outside the Philippines, with a view to improving and integrating the import services and associated customs revenue gathering of the Philippines. The focal point of SGS\'s services was the provision, in the Philippines, of a reliable inspection certificate (termed a Clean Report of Findings (CRF)) on the basis of which import clearance could be expedited and the appropriate duty charged. SGS\'s inspections abroad were not carried out for their own sake but in order to enable it to provide, in the Philippines, an inspection certificate on which BOC* \\[the Philippines Bureau of Customs] *could rely to enter goods to the customs territory of the Philippines and to assess and collect the ensuing revenue.* \\[…] *Further, those operations were organized through the Manila Liaison Office, which under Article 5 of the CISS Agreement SGS was obliged to "continue and maintain… until the date upon which this Agreement ceases to be effective or its implementation is interrupted or indefinitely suspended." This was a substantial office, employing a significant number of people*.357\n\n[*SGS Société Générale de Surveillance S.A. v.

SGS had agreements with the governments of Pakistan and the Philippines for the provision of services regarding the import of goods into the two States. It provided the reports, which were the central feature of its obligation under the agreements, in the territory of those States, even though the inspections were conducted elsewhere, and SGS itself maintained the offices in the respondent States which delivered these reports.\n\n[]()\n\n270\\.\n\nBy contrast, in the present case, North Star had no agreement with the Government of Norway to provide anything. Moreover, two separate entities were involved. North Star was a fishing enterprise incorporated in Latvia and distinct from the processing and marketing concern to which it sold its crab. North Star\'s fishing vessels, registered in and licensed by Latvia, harvested snow crab primarily on the Russian continental shelf. The fact that North Star then landed the crab in Norway and sold it to a separate entity, Seagourmet, is not sufficient to make Norway the focus of the North Star enterprise. While the focus of Seagourmet\'s activities was in Norway, the focus of North Star\'s operations was either in Latvia or the Russian Federation. An holistic view would therefore point to the conclusion that North Star lacked an investment in Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n271\\.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that the main focus of a company\'s activities lies outside the territory of a State does not preclude the possibility that aspects of its activities taking place within the territory of that State might amount to an investment in that State. The Tribunal will, therefore, consider each of the five alleged investments in turn.\n\n[]()\n\n272\\.\n\nSo far as the fishing vessels themselves are concerned, the Tribunal considers that Latvian vessels which harvested a natural resource on the continental shelf of the Russian Federation pursuant to licences granted by Latvia cannot be regarded as an investment in the territory of Norway, even though they subsequently landed and sold their catch at a Norwegian port. The fact that they may have taken a small part of the catch in Norwegian territory does not alter the fact that the main locus of their fishing activity was outside Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n273\\.\n\nIt is true that in June 2016, shortly before the introduction by the Russian Federation of the ban on taking snow crab on the Russian continental shelf, the *Senator* attempted to take snow crab on Norwegian territory.358 The *Senator* was arrested and North Star fined for this attempt, although that did not occur until September 2016 after the Russian ban came into effect. The Tribunal does not consider, however, that this attempt alters the basic fact that the North Star fleet had been fishing almost exclusively in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole until Russia enacted its ban.\n\nSee paragraphs 112-113, above.\n\n[]()\n\n274\\.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, up to the end of September 2016, the four North Star vessels cannot be regarded as an investment by North Star in the territory of Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n275\\.\n\nNor can the Tribunal accept that the fishing licences for the four vessels constituted an investment in Norway. Those licences were granted not by Norway but by Latvia. They did not confer any rights on North Star vis-à-vis Norway. Like the fishing capacity which North Star acquired for its four ships, the licences were necessary for North Star to comply with EU law requirements for fishing in the NEAFC area. Even if North Star had intended, at the time that it applied for and was granted those licences and the capacity rights, to take snow crab mainly in Norwegian territory, the Tribunal doubts that licences granted by another State in order to satisfy non-Norwegian requirements could be regarded as an investment in Norway. However, at that time, North Star intended to conduct most of its fishing activities in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. In these circumstances, neither the licences nor the capacity rights can be regarded as an investment in the territory of Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n276\\.\n\nOnce North Star ceased to be able to take snow crab in the Loop Hole, it then decided to redirect its efforts to the waters off Svalbard.359 In doing so, it hoped to take advantage of the provisions of Article 2 of the Svalbard Treaty360 under which, according to the Claimants, nationals of all the parties to the Treaty are entitled to take crab in the waters around Svalbard. That interpretation of the Treaty is contested by Norway, which maintains that the rights conferred by Article 2 apply only on land and in the territorial sea and not in the Fisheries Protection Zone or continental shelf. The Tribunal will discuss the Svalbard Treaty in more detail later (see Section V.B(4), below). For the moment, however, the only question is whether this proposed redeployment alters the conclusion that North Star\'s fishing vessels were not an investment in the territory of Norway.\n\nPildegovics WS1, para. 207. See also paragraph 113, above.\n\n*See* Note 7, above (**CL-0002**).\n\n[]()\n\n277\\.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that it does not do so. Latvia became a party to the Svalbard Treaty only in June 2016 and first granted licences to the North Star vessels to fish off Svalbard in November 2016.361 Only the *Senator* ever attempted to take snow crab off Svalbard (in January 2017) and was arrested when attempting to do so. The Tribunal does not consider that the mere grant of licences by Latvia was sufficient to render the vessels an investment in Norwegian territory. Moreover, by the time that the licences were granted and the *Senator* attempted to harvest snow crab off Svalbard, it was well known that Norwegian law prohibited fishing for snow crab within 200 nautical miles of Svalbard. That prohibition had been adopted in the 2014 Regulations and was maintained (with a reference to the continental shelf rather than the Fisheries Protection Zone) in the 2015 Regulations.362 Thus, whatever the dispute regarding the effect of Articles 2 and 3 of the Svalbard Treaty, there was no doubt that the taking of snow crab off Svalbard was prohibited by Norwegian law. Accordingly, even if the proposed redeployment of the North Star fleet was capable of amounting to an investment in Norwegian territory, it was not one which was made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Norway and does not, therefore, meet the requirements of the BIT.\n\nLicences were granted for *Saldus* (**C-0006**), *Senator* (**C-0013**), *Solveiga* (**C-0020**) and *Solvita* (**C-0026**) on 1 November 2016. These licences were stated to be valid for the remainder of 2016 and new licences were granted in January 2017.\n\nSee paragraphs 85 and 90, above.\n\n[]()\n\n278\\.\n\nSo far as the two ships which North Star intended to purchase (*Sokol* and *Solyaris*) are concerned, the Tribunal has reached the same conclusion as it has done with regard to the four ships which North Star had already acquired. Even if the contracts for purchase of the vessels, and the licences and fishing capacity which were acquired in respect of them, were capable of amounting to an investment, it did not meet the requirements of the BIT. Those steps which North Star took until September 2016 were taken with a view to the *Sokol* and the *Solyaris* joining the existing four North Star vessels taking snow crab mainly in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. At that stage, for the reasons already given, any investment represented by the two vessels would not have been an investment in the territory of Norway. Thereafter, if it was intended that they would take crab off Svalbard, then this would not have been an investment in accordance with the laws and regulations of Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n279\\.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the first four items claimed as investments by North Star—namely, the fishing vessels operated by the company, the fishing licences granted by Latvia, the fishing capacity granted in respect of the four vessels and the contract to purchase two further vessels—do not constitute investments within the meaning of the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n280\\.\n\nThat leaves the fifth claimed investment, North Star\'s claimed right to payment from Seagourmet and the other processing facilities for snow crab landed in Norway by North Star. Article I(1)(iii) of the BIT includes, as an example of an investment, "*claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims to any performance under contract having an economic value*". It appears that North Star and Seagourmet did not conclude written agreements for the supply of snow crab until late in 2016, after the bans on taking snow crab in the Loop Hole entered into force in both Russia and Norway. The Tribunal attaches no significance to these later written agreements which post-date the events said to constitute the breach of the BIT and were concluded at a time when both parties must have known that there was no realistic prospect of performance. The question, therefore, is whether there is sufficient evidence that, before then there was an unwritten contract that Seagourmet would take, at market price, the snow crab offered to it by North Star the extent of Seagourmet\'s capacity. To some extent North Star\'s argument that that was the case suffers from the same defects as the arguments regarding the existence of the supposd "joint venture". Nevertheless, there is evidence that North Star delivered most of its snow crab to Seagourmet before July 2016, that it was being paid for that snow crab, that North Star provided all of Seagourmet\'s snow crab and that both companies were proceeding on the basis that North Star would supply Seagourmet\'s needs and that Seagourmet would continue to take delivery of, and pay for, the snow crab harvested by North Star unless that exceeded Seagourmet\'s processing capacity.363 While the Tribunal has some reservations about the asserted unwritten agreement between the two companies, it has nevertheless concluded that the evidence that the contractual relationship between North Star and Seagourmet went beyond a series of unconnected contracts for the sale of goods and that North Star operated on the basis that Seagourmet had an obligation to take and pay for catches of snow crab; this is sufficient to justify the Tribunal in finding that North Star had an investment within the meaning of Article I(1)(iii) of the BIT.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 144, lines 6-15 (Mr Pildegovics). See also the sample invoice dated 6 January 2016 (**PP-0153**).\n\n[]()\n\n281\\.\n\nNorway argues that the claim to performance was located in Latvia, not Norway, since payment was made by Seagourmet to North Star\'s bank account in Latvia.364 The Tribunal considers this argument to be somewhat artificial. North Star was obliged to deliver, and Seagourmet to take delivery, of the crab in Norway. That was the act which triggered the obligation of payment. Invoices were sent to Seagourmet\'s offices there. The fact that payment was made to a bank account in Latvia, as opposed to one in Norway, is not sufficient to alter the character of the claim to performance as one which was located in Norway. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that North Star had an investment in Norway in the form of its rights under the contract or contracts with Seagourmet.\n\nSee the sample invoice at **PP-0153**.\n\n[]()\n\n282\\.\n\nThe first catch of snow crab obtained by North Star from the Loop Hole (by the *Solvita* in August 2014) was sold to another facility because Seagourmet\'s plant was not yet ready.365 The Tribunal does not consider that this one-off sale amounts to an investment. The Tribunal has no information regarding the terms on which North Star supplied snow crab to other facilities during 2015 and 2016. Nevertheless, for the purpose of determining whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction, it accepts that North Star would not have delivered crab without receiving some payment and that there must therefore have been agreements, whether written or oral, between North Star and the owners of the other facilities. There is, however, no evidence that these were anything other than isolated contracts for sale concluded when North Star had quantities of snow crab which Seagourmet could not accept. In particular, there is nothing to suggest that any agreement existed whereby any processing company other than Seagourmet had undertaken in advance to accept snow crab from North Star. On the contrary, the evidence suggests only that North Star sold any snow crab which was surplus to Seagourmet\'s requirements wherever it could do so. The Tribunal does not regard its actions in doing so as an investment in Norway; there was no guarantee that it would be able to find a buyer for future landings of snow crab which Seagourmet did not require.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 26, lines 21-25 (Mr Pildegovics).\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(iv) Was Mr Levanidov the "real investor"?***\n\n[]()\n\n283\\.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that, even if there were investments in Norway nominally held by the Claimants, the real or true investor was Mr Levanidov, who, not being a Latvian national, cannot be a claimant in this case.\n\n[]()\n\n284\\.\n\nThe record before the Tribunal does not support this contention. It is true that the idea for an integrated harvesting, processing and marketing operation came from Mr Levanidov, that it was his colleague, Mr Ankipov, who made the initial inquiries to the Norwegian Government and established Sea &amp; Coast and that one of Mr Levanidov\'s companies bought up North Star\'s debts. Nevertheless, that would not suffice to make Mr Levanidov the "*real investor*". In addition, Mr Pildegovics has testified that he put his own money into North Star and Sea &amp; Coast.\n\n[]()\n\n285\\.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal has held that North Star, a Latvian company, had an investment in Norwegian territory. Even if it had been proved by Norway that it was Mr Levanidov that had supplied the funds to North Star, that would not in itself deprive North Star of its status as an investor and its right to claim under the BIT in respect of that investment.\n\n[]()\n\n286\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects Norway\'s argument that Mr Levanidov has to be treated as the real investor to the exclusion of North Star and Mr Pildegovics.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(v) Conclusion***\n\n[]()\n\n287\\.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\'s Second Objection insofar as it relates to the following investments:-\n\n\\- the rights of Mr Pildegovics in respect of his shareholding in Sea &amp; Coast, an investment dating from October 2015; and\n\n\\- the rights of North Star under its agreements with Seagourmet, an investment dating from the beginning of 2015.\n\n[]()\n\n288\\.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Claimants\' argument that they held other investments in Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n289\\.\n\nSubject to what is said below regarding the Respondent\'s First Objection, the Tribunal therefore concludes that it has jurisdiction but only in respect of the dispute to the extent that it relates to the investments as set out in paragraph 287, above.\n\n[]()\n\n## **(4) The Respondent\'s First Objection**\n\n[]()\n\n290\\.\n\nHaving established the nature and limits of the investments of each Claimant, the Tribunal can now turn to the Respondent\'s First Objection. That objection is put in two different but related ways.\n\n[]()\n\n291\\.\n\nThe Respondent first argues that the subject matter of the dispute which the Claimants seek to bring before the Tribunal does not arise directly out of their investments but rather out of international agreements—specifically, UNCLOS, the Svalbard Treaty and the NEAFC Convention. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to interpret and apply these treaties but without resolving the inter-State disputes which arise under them cannot rule on the claims of either Claimant.\n\n[]()\n\n292\\.\n\nSecondly, Norway maintains that the rights and obligations of States not party to the present proceeding would have to be determined before any ruling could be made on the issues that might arise under the BIT. The Respondent argues that for the Tribunal to rule on the rights and interests of third parties— in particular, Latvia, the EU and the Russian Federation—would be contrary to the principle laid down by the International Court of Justice in the *Monetary Gold*366 and *East Timor*367 cases.\n\nSee Note 124, above.\n\n[*Case Concerning East Timor Case* (*Portugal v. Australia*), ICJ, Judgment, 30 June 1995](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/dysxN2U4UGJ1Nk9FcWFJaTh2S3Ztc2ZUNFI3V0xqallOWmxKRVB5Q0hQaDlrSXZqcDZ5ck1rS2doYUcrSDJiQlFHODR6MWVHME42WStiVDJOMmZWcjA0cEdGbHZ0ZXVQb2VBRVU4ODhlc1U9) (**RL-0092**).\n\n[]()\n\n293\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this objection, in whichever way it is put, is one which goes to the admissibility of the claim rather than the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. That is one reason why it has addressed this objection only after it has dealt with Norway\'s Second Objection—if there is no jurisdiction, then questions of admissibility do not arise. Another, more practical, reason is that until the precise nature and limits of the Claimants\' investments have been identified, it is difficult to say whether a decision in respect of them would run counter to the principles relied on by Norway in its First Objection.\n\n[]()\n\n294\\.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that the present dispute does not arise directly out of the investments which it has found the Claimants to have possessed. A dispute may arise directly out of an investment and require the interpretation and application of the provisions of a bilateral investment treaty even though it also involves other rules of international law which may be derived from treaties involving other States. An investment tribunal seised of such a case is not deprived of the jurisdiction granted to it by the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Indeed, such a tribunal may well be required to rule on an issue of interpretation of the ICSID Convention which is contested between different States party to that Convention. Nor is the claim before such a tribunal thereby rendered inadmissible.\n\n[]()\n\n295\\.\n\nNevertheless, such a tribunal needs to be conscious of the limits of its authority. UNCLOS tribunals have held that, in determining maritime entitlements between two States, they may not rule on the sovereignty over the land territory from which maritime entitlements are claimed to derive.368 In the present case, the Tribunal is not entitled to rule on the dispute between the different parties to the Svalbard Treaty on whether or not Article 2 of that Treaty requires Norway to allow nationals of the other States parties access to hunting and fishing resources on the continental shelf around Svalbard.369 That does not, however, prevent the Tribunal from determining whether either Claimant has made an investment which meets the requirements of the BIT in the waters around Svalbard. For the reasons given above, the Tribunal has held that neither Claimant made such an investment.\n\nSee [*Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration* (*Mauritius v.

In its subsequent case-law on this point, the International Court of Justice has made clear that this principle is applicable only when the rights and obligations of the third State form the very subject matter of the dispute before it. In the *East Timor* case, the Court held that Portugal\'s claim that Australia had failed to recognize the right of self-determination of the people of East Timor in its dealings with the Government of Indonesia (which at that time occupied East Timor) could not be decided without determining whether Indonesia had itself acted contrary to that right by occupying the territory after the collapse of Portuguese administration in 1975. Unless Indonesia had acted unlawfully, Australian recognition of the situation brought about by Indonesia could not be unlawful. By contrast, in the *Nauru* case,370 the Court held that it could rule on Australia\'s actions in mining for phosphate on Nauru without having first to determine whether the United Kingdom or New Zealand had acted unlawfully.\n\n[*Case Concerning Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru* (*Nauru v.

The email at issue mentioned only that "\\[a]*s stated in §2* \\[of the regulation] *vessels that are to fish in waters outside any state\'s fisheries jurisdiction must be registered through notification to the Directorate of Fisheries*" and that "\\[t]*he processing of registration notifications will normally take 2-3 days*". According to the Respondent, this was not a statement that the Claimants\' vessels were able to be registered under this regulation since the referenced regulation was not applicable to foreign vessels, such as those of the Claimants, and still less meant that was only a formality.604\n\nResp. Counter-Memorial, para. 736.3.\n\n[]()\n\n406\\.\n\nAs to the landing of snow crab that allegedly amounted to the Respondent\'s consent to the harvesting of snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf, the Respondent relies on the same arguments as set out above. In essence, the Respondent submits that the Claimants conflate, on the one hand, an authorization to *land* snow crab harvested anywhere (*e.g.* on the Russian continental shelf within the Loop Hole) with, on the other hand, an authorization to *harvest* snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf.605\n\nResp.

Counter-Memorial, para. 738.1.\n\n[]()\n\n408\\.\n\nThe July 2014 response of the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries to the question from Mr Ankipov about the "process regarding the documents to be sent to the Directorate of Fisheries" where "a fishing vessel under the EU flag will land live snow crabs at approved Norwegian reception stations" was that:\n\n*1. In principle, EU vessels can land fish, including snow crab to Norway on an equal footing with Norwegian fishing vessels* \\[…]*.*\n\n*2.

According to the Respondent, the Directorate of Fisheries did not—and Mr Ankipov did not ask it to—represent that any harvesting activity outside the Norwegian Economic Zone would be lawful.608 In sum, the Respondent denies that the above-mentioned exchanges in any way verified the legality of North Star\'s harvesting or could have been the basis for any legitimate expectations.609\n\nResp.

Counter-Memorial, para. 739.\n\n[]()\n\n410\\.\n\nThe Respondent claims that none of the Claimants\' further alleged representations "*throughout 2015*", could have been the basis for any legitimate expectations. As a preliminary argument, the Respondent notes that several of the Claimants\' investments, including the four vessels, had already been acquired at that time. Since a touchstone for legitimate expectations is the reliance thereon by an investor in the making of the investment, any representations post-dating the making of the investment cannot have been adversely relied upon.610\n\nResp. Counter-Memorial, para. 740.\n\n[]()\n\n411\\.\n\nReviewing each representation alleged by the Claimants, the Respondent submits:\n\n• On 10 June 2015, the Mayor of Båtsfjord attended and cut the ribbon at the launch of the Seagourmet factory: the fact that the Mayor supported the opening of the Seagourmet factory, a factory not owned by the Claimants, which processed already landed crab, cannot have been a representation to the Claimants about the legality of harvesting snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf.611\n\n• Visits by members of the Norwegian Parliament and Norwegian officials to Båtsfjord in September and October 2015: a general visit to several businesses in Båtsfjord and the "*blessings and best wishes of success*" in support of the Seagourmet factory by Norwegian officials cannot be equated with a representation regarding the legality of harvesting snow crab on Norway\'s continental shelf.612\n\n• Visit by Norway\'s Minister of Fisheries, Ms Elisabeth Aspaker, to the Seagourmet factory on 8 September 2015 and that she "*expressed no reservations*" about the fact that Latvian-flagged vessels were responsible for the catches: the Claimants do not allege that they told Minister Aspaker that any of their harvesting was taking place in the area of the Loop Hole that comprised the Norwegian continental shelf. Minister Aspaker\'s silence can thus not reasonably be any ground for legitimate expectations.613\n\n• On 23 October 2015, a delegation from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries visited Seagourmet\'s factory: this was not a visit specifically to Seagourmet but a more general trip to Båtsfjord.614 The Claimants allege that the delegation was "*informed of Seagourmet\'s dependence on North Star\'s deliveries of snow crabs caught in the Loop Hole*". However, the Respondent emphasizes that there is no evidence that the delegation was told that any of the harvesting took place on the Norwegian continental shelf in the Loop Hole. Moreover, no specific representation by the delegation is relied on and the Claimants merely allege that it "*appeared enthusiastic about the project and gave their encouragements*", which does not suffice for any legitimate expectations.615\n\n• The approval given by Minister Aspaker of substantial investments for the refurbishment of Båtsfjord port: this was a general investment that cannot sensibly be isolated as a representation vis-à-vis the Claimants regarding anything, let alone on the legality of foreign vessels harvesting snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf.616\n\nResp.

The Respondent alleges that the Claimants have failed to identify such a specific undertaking and can therefore not have held any legitimate general expectation of stability of the regulatory framework.619\n\nResp.

If the answer was positive, as it was in this case, there was no need to consider the geographical scope of the provisions of the Svalbard Treaty.630 Contrary to what the Claimants allege, there was no *volte face* by the Supreme Court when it did touch upon aspects of the Svalbard Treaty in its ruling. The Supreme Court\'s case management decision was that it would reserve solely the question of the geographical scope of the Svalbard Treaty to a later phase and did not exclude dealing with other aspects of the Svalbard Treaty if otherwise pertinent.631 According to the Respondent, not dealing with every argument presented by the parties to a case does not amount to a refusal to exercise its function, let alone to a denial of justice.632\n\nResp.

Instead, "*treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State*" means that the Claimants must show (1) that the Respondent has accorded actual treatment; (2) to an investment made by an investor of a third State.665 The Claimants must thus establish that the comparative Russian vessels were in fact investments in the territory of Norway.666\n\nResp.

That premise is "*obstructed – perhaps defeated*" if every fishing license granted to one State automatically generates rights to the same treatment for all other States which have concluded a BIT containing an MFN provision with the coastal State concerned.669 The Respondent alleges this is a straightforward application of basic principles of treaty interpretation to the MFN clause and of the need to avoid manifestly absurd interpretations. The MFN principle can operate only where the treatment being compared relates to "*persons or things in the same relationship*" with the States concerned, like must be compared with like.670\n\nResp.

The Russian Federation had a relevant bilateral fishing agreement with Norway while Latvia had not. The EU (on behalf of Latvia) had declined to negotiate an exchange of catch quotas with Norway, and EU States and investors could not claim the very same rights of access to Norwegian continental shelf resources as States that had negotiated such agreements. Comparing investments by such different classes of investors is not comparing like with like.671\n\nResp.

Counter-Memorial, para. 816.\n\n[]()\n\n440\\.\n\nBased on the same arguments made with regard to the MFN clause above, the Respondent further objects to the Claimants\' use of the MFN clause to incorporate the national treatment standard found in the Norway-Russian Federation BIT into the BIT applicable in this arbitration.673 In addition, the Respondent remarks that the national treatment standard in Article 3 of the Norway-Russian Federation BIT that is subject "*other treatment* \\[being] *required by its legislation*", which in any event prevents the Claimants\' reliance on this clause.674\n\nResp.

However, whether a provision of one of those treaties is relevant to the determination of whether Norway has breached a provision of the BIT is not a matter on which it is safe to generalise; that question must be considered in the context of the specific facts and allegation raised.

These claims will be considered in that order.\n\n[]()\n\n455\\.\n\nFirst, however, the Tribunal considers it necessary to examine two matters which cut across the different claims: the status of snow crab as a sedentary species and the effect of the measures taken by the Russian Federation.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***b.

According to the Claimants, Norway took this decision not for scientific reasons but to ensure that it took control of the snow crab stock in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole for the benefit of its own fishing industry and to give it a bargaining counter in its dispute with the EU over access to marine resources.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 23, line 25 (Mr Savoie).\n\n[]()\n\n457\\.\n\nNorway, on the other hand, maintains that it is not a matter of "*designation*". The definition of a sedentary species is a matter of law under Article 77(4) of UNCLOS, which provides that sedentary species are "*organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant contact with the seabed or subsoil*". According to Norway, either a species falls within this definition or it does not. If it does, then it is sedentary and no designation as such by a coastal State is required. Norway maintains that it has consistently regarded crabs (of all varieties) as sedentary within this definition and that it is "*blindingly obvious*" that snow crab is a sedentary species.692\n\nResp. Counter-Memorial, para. 474.\n\n[]()\n\n458\\.\n\nArticle 77(4) is a provision taken over verbatim from [Article 2 of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/S2VVN09EOGhRRHg0SlZ3SS9qUjlwRUFpMUI3RlhNbXNCZmZtaUFrMEVqNU1LZVZEUXg2eEhlQ3EyZ1E4bkpRSFFIVDJJL3JzZHlTaVVDZ1k0dlZiLy9RbUxlbGRaQUM4VW1McS9HbzRiWFZ5RHd1OE9uK1YwZ3lEdVh1V0J6bjMzOUs1L0hIY0RlRWM1TkV1ekFQak1CVy8zK05ZQXZQVWliejdOYmR0QzJVPQ==). At the conference which adopted the 1958 Convention, Norway had originally opposed including living creatures such as crustaceans within the resources over which the coastal State would have control by virtue of its sovereign rights over the continental shelf. For the Claimants, that stance shows that Norway had not then considered crab to be sedentary. That argument misunderstands the position which Norway adopted in 1958. Norway, together with several other States, opposed the proposal to include living resources within the coastal State\'s continental shelf rights. The Norwegian stance was about what should be allocated to the coastal State, not what fell within the definition of a sedentary species. Moreover, Norway withdrew its opposition and ratified first the 1958 Convention and then UNCLOS.\n\n[]()\n\n459\\.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Norway that whether the snow crab is a sedentary species is a matter of law, namely whether it falls within the definition in Article 77(4), and that no designation is required. What happened in 2014–2015 was that, after considerable internal discussion and talks with the Russian Federation, Norway concluded that snow crab did come within the definition in Article 77(4).\n\n[]()\n\n460\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Norway\'s stance in this proceeding — that it has been completely consistent since 1958 in recognizing the "*blindingly obvious*" fact that crab, including snow crab, are sedentary — is difficult to reconcile with the hesitation which its internal documents reveal during the period 2014 to 2015. It is worth briefly examining the main features of the discussions within the Norwegian Government and between that Government and the Russian Federation.\n\n[]()\n\n461\\.\n\nIn its responses to inquiries from the Claimants and Mr Levanidov\'s staff in 2013 and 2014, Norway made no reference to the possibility that it had continental shelf rights in respect of the snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole (although the exchanges between them, which will be reviewed in greater detail below at paragraphs 513 to 523, contain no discussion of whether the snow crab is a sedentary or non-sedentary species). Moreover, the 2014 Regulations addressed the issue of taking snow crab through the frame of exclusive economic zone rights and did not apply to the Norwegian outer continental shelf in the Loop Hole.\n\n[]()\n\n462\\.\n\nThe initiative in suggesting that the snow crab is sedentary and thus that the stock in the Loop Hole could be managed by Norway and the Russian Federation relying on their continental shelf rights seems to have come from Russia at a meeting of the Joint Norway-Russia Fisheries Commission in October 2014. A Norwegian official attending the meeting commented in an email to a colleague that "*Russia seems to assume at the meeting that the snow crab is a sedentary species that is covered by their shelf jurisdiction so that fishing for snow crab in the Smutthullet will not be regulated by NEAFC*".693\n\nEmail from Ms Therese Johansen to Ms Kristina Nygård, 7 October 2014 (**C-0191**). Ms Johansen, in an email sent as the Joint Norway-Russia Fisheries Commission was about to hold its October 2014 meeting, asked "\\[i]*sn\'t the snow crab a sedentary species* \\[…] *that is covered by the* \\[continental] *shelf jurisdiction?*": see Email from Ms Therese Johansen to Ms Kristina Nygård, 22 September 2014 (**C-0192**).\n\n[]()\n\n463\\.\n\nOn 31 October 2014, Ms Elisabeth Gabrielsen, Deputy Director General of the Fisheries and Acquaculture Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries wrote to Ms Christine Finbak, Senior Adviser in the Legal Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:\n\n*At the Commission meeting in October, the Russians referred to the fact that snow crab are a benthic species and that fishing in the Loop Hole is regulated by continental shelf jurisdiction.* \\[…]\n\n*NEAFC\'s annual meeting is in 2 weeks and we are currently working on a mandate for the negotiations. What are your views on this issue*?694\n\nEmail from Ms Elisabeth Gabrielsen to Ms Christine Finbak, 31 October 2014 (**R-0097**).\n\n[]()\n\n464\\.\n\nThe two later held a conversation after which Ms Finbak replied, on 4 November 2014:\n\n*As mentioned, we have had a preliminary round here. In order to conclude whether snow crab are a sedentary species, it will be necessary to obtain a scientific assessment from the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research.* \\[…]\n\n*With regard to the NEAFC meeting, it will be important to have a flexible mandate which we will not be bound by, because it will probably be difficult to reach a conclusion in the short period of time until the meeting*.695\n\nEmail from Ms Christine Finbak to Ms Elisabeth Gabrielsen, 4 November 2014 (**R-0097**).\n\n[]()\n\n465\\.\n\nThe NEAFC meeting took place between 10 and 14 November 2014. The mandate for the Norwegian delegation, issued by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, included the following:\n\n*Russia signalled during the last meeting of the mixed commission that they considered that the snow crab is a sedentary species, and that in this case it means that it is the continental shelf jurisdiction that applies to the management of the crab. It cannot be ruled out that they will raise this issue at this meeting. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the process of investigating the legal aspects and consequences for the management of snow crab as a potential sedentary species. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked us to "lie low" in this case until the case is better clarified on the Norwegian side. Completely new information from KV also indicates that there is currently no fishing for snow crab on the Norwegian shelf outside NØS (only on the Russian shelf).*\n\n\\[…]\n\n*The delegation will as far as possible await the situation. Should there be an initiative regarding snow crab that needs to be decided on, the delegation will discuss the matter with the department for a further mandate in this area*.696\n\nFisheries and Aquaculture Department , Mandate for the 33rd Annual Meeting of NEAFC", 28 October 2014 (**C-0256**), p. 2.\n\n[]()\n\n466\\.\n\nOn 4 November 2014, in response to an inquiry from Ms Gabrielsen, which quoted Article 77(4) and asked whether snow crab fell within the definition therein, Mr Jan Sundet (a researcher at the Norwegian Institute of Maritime Research)697 responded:\n\n*From the last part of the article, "…* or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil,*" there is little doubt that the snow crab must be considered an immobile species - in contrast to migratory species. The direct meaning of the term "*sedentary*" in biology is "*fixed*", and it is not. In the* "catchable" *stage, it moves, but is completely dependent on having contact with the seabed to be able to move.*\n\n*Of course, I am not an expert on the Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the text referred to here is as far as I can see unequivocal. The conclusion is therefore that it must be considered sedentary even if the term itself is not particularly good in the description of the snow crab*.698\n\nSee R. Churchill, J. Sundet and G. Ulfstein, "The Snow Crab as a \'Sedentary Species\', in 57 Lov og Rett (2018), p. 510 (**RL-0176**).\n\nEmail from Mr Jan Sundet to Mr Harald Loeng, 4 November 2014 (**C-0186**) (responding to an inquiry of the same date from Ms Gabrielsen).\n\n[]()\n\n467\\.\n\nWhile the Claimants describe this reply, which was sent within an hour of Mr Sundet having received the inquiry, as "*somewhat tentative*",699 the Tribunal does not see it as such. Mr Sundet points out that the biological concept of "*sedentary*" is something which does not move at all, but he then recognizes that the term has a different meaning in law. While acknowledging that he is not an expert on the law, he states unequivocally that the snow crab, in what Article 77(4) refers to as the "*harvestable stage*", can move only in contact with the seabed and thus falls within the definition of a sedentary species in the Convention.\n\nCl. Reply, para. 60.\n\n[]()\n\n468\\.\n\nMr Sundet produced a more detailed note on 15 January 2015. That note traced the history of snow crab in the Barents Sea and pointed out that the main concentration appeared to be in the Russian continental shelf but that there was a chance that the crab would migrate to the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone. He stated:\n\n*The snow crab eats and lives on the bottom all its life except in the larval phase where the larvae live in the upper water masses up to several months before they settle.*\n\n\\[…]\n\n*After bottoming, the snow crab, like most other crab species, depends on the bottom to be able to move. There are a few species of so-called* "swimming crabs" *that use transformed walking legs to swim, but it is not known that such species have been found in our waters. The beach crab has something similar to* "swimming legs" *but it only lives in the littoral zone and is not of commercial importance in our areas either*.700\n\nJ. Sundet, "Note: Status of the Snow Crab in the Barents Sea", 15 January 2015 (**C-0254**), p. 3.\n\n[]()\n\n469\\.\n\nOn 19 January 2015, Ms Finbak provided a written opinion to Ms Gabrielsen in which she said that her section of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had made a "*preliminary assessment of the issue with a view to communicating a preliminary Norwegian position at the meeting of NEAFC\'s PECCOE (the Permanent Committee on Control and Enforcement)*".701 PECCOE had before it a proposal for a recommendation under Article 5 of the NEAFC Convention related to snow crab. The opinion noted that NEAFC had the power to adopt recommendations regarding crustaceans but under Article 6 could do so in relation to resources within the national jurisdiction of a State only if that State requested it to do so. If snow crab were sedentary, then any snow crab in the Loop Hole fell within Article 6.\n\nOpinion of Ms Finbak, 19 January 2015 (**C-0249**), p. 1.\n\n[]()\n\n470\\.\n\nReferring to Mr Sundet\'s note, Ms Finbak gave as her section\'s preliminary assessment:\n\n*Historically, it has not been entirely obvious that the crab, including the snow crab, is considered a sedentary species according to the Convention on the Law of the Sea Article 77 (4). The content of the provision was little discussed during the Conference on the Law of the Sea, other than that a proposal from several states (including Norway) during the 1958 conference that crustaceans and swimming species should not be included was the subject of discussion and was finally voted down in plenum. There have been several conflicts related to the interpretation of the provision (mainly in the 60s), i.a. related to the king crab between resp. Japan and the United States and the Soviet Union and the United States. The United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement in 1964 which meant that the king crab was considered a* "*natural resource of the continental shelf", but the Soviet Union was allowed to fish for king crab on more specific terms. Although it seems relatively open for a period whether the crab is to be regarded as a sedentary species, recent literature seems quite unambiguous by assuming that the crab is to be regarded as a sedentary species that follows shelf jurisdiction.*\n\n*It is the section\'s preliminary assessment that there are good reasons for considering the snow crab as a sedentary species which is thus subject to shelf jurisdiction. This means that the snow crab in this case is regulated by the relevant shelf state (s). We have understood that the snow crab at the moment is mainly located on the Russian shelf. However, we have been informed by IMR that it will be able to move over to the Norwegian shelf.*\n\n*Recommendation:*\n\n*The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Section for Treaty Law, Environmental Law and the Law of the Sea recommends that during the PECCOE meeting the Norwegian side refers to [Article 77 (4) of the Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTI0Y21mS1ovVWZ5czMxb1phYzZJbExnPT0=) and that it may be considered that the snow crab is a sedentary species covered by shelf jurisdiction. This means that it is not natural for the species to be included in NEAFC\'s Annex I. However, it will be useful to clarify with other states how they assess this issue, in particular Russia\'s assessment will be important in this context. We ask to be informed about the discussions during the PECCOE meeting, so that we on the Norwegian side can prepare a clearer Norwegian position ahead of NEAFC\'s annual meeting*.702\n\nOpinion of Ms Finbak, 19 January 2015 (**C-0249**), p. 2.\n\n[]()\n\n471\\.\n\nIn a report on the PECCOE meeting, Mr Terje Løbach of the Directorate of Fisheries stated:\n\n*The EU had proposed to define prawns and snow crab as resources managed by NEAFC, including the obligations that follow from this regarding reporting etc. Both Russia and Norway said that they are still considering the status of snow crab and that it is very likely that it is to be defined as a sedentary species, and therefore will be under the jurisdiction of the coastal state in accordance with [Article 77(4) of the Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTI0Y21mS1ovVWZ5czMxb1phYzZJbExnPT0=). Russia put forward the same argument regarding prawns (!). PECCOE will therefore not submit proposals to the Commission regarding either prawns or snow crab*.703\n\nEmail from Mr Terje Løbach to Ms Ann-Kristin Westberg, 28 January 2015 (**R-0016**)\n\n[]()\n\n472\\.\n\nIn June 2015, an internal memorandum of the Norwegian Government, repeating much of Ms Finbak\'s preliminary assessment of January 2015, concluded:\n\n*The EU has raised the issue of regulation of snow crab in NEAFC, both at the Commission meeting in 2014 and in PECCOE, but so far without success. Russia has stated in the NEAFC that they consider the snow crab as a sedentary species that must be managed according to the shelf jurisdiction in accordance with the Convention on the Law of the Sea. From the Norwegian side, it was communicated in PECCO in January that we currently have the case under consideration, but that there is much to suggest that the snow crab is a sedentary species according to [UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 77 (4)](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTI0Y21mS1ovVWZ5czMxb1phYzZJbExnPT0=).*\n\n*On 1 April, the EU sent a letter to NEAFC and all delegation leaders informing them that an EU vessel intends to conduct experimental fishing for snow crab and red king crab in parts of the Smutthullet in accordance with Recommendation 19:2015 (recommendation related to the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in NEAFC\'s regulatory area). The relevant area is the Russian continental shelf, cf. the Demarcation Agreement of 2010. If the snow crab and red king crab are considered sedentary species, they will be subject to shelf jurisdiction and it will be up to the coastal state to decide on any experimental fishing in the relevant area, cf. [Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 77 (2)](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTJSSS9lVjRCZHFEcEY2cGtERHBqSzBnPT0=). Given that the relevant area where experimental fishing is to be carried out is subject to Russian shelf jurisdiction, it is Russia that has the clearest interest in pointing this out to NEAFC. At the same time, the snow crab will eventually also be able to be on the Norwegian shelf and it will therefore be in Norway\'s interest to point out to NEAFC that NEAFC here cannot allow experimental fishing without the coastal state\'s consent.*\n\n\\[…]\n\n*It is the Section\'s assessment that there are good reasons for considering the snow crab as a sedentary species which is thus subject to shelf jurisdiction. This means that the snow crab in this relevant case is regulated by the relevant shelf state and that utilization requires explicit permission from the coastal state, cf. Article 77 (2)* \\[of UNCLOS].704\n\nMemorandum, "Snow Crab", 6 June 2015 (**C-0193**).\n\n[]()\n\n473\\.\n\nShortly afterwards, on 17 July 2015, Norway and the Russian Federation, meeting in Malta (see paragraph 86, above), agreed that they "*will proceed from the fact that harvesting of sedentary species, including snow crab, in the NEAFC Regulatory Area in the Barents Sea shall not be carried out without the express assent of the coastal State*".705\n\nMalta Declaration (**C-0106**).\n\n[]()\n\n474\\.\n\nOn 3 August 2015, Mr Arne Røksund of the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries wrote to the Federal Russian Fisheries Agency to follow up on the Agreed Minutes of the Malta meeting. He stated:\n\n*I refer to the agreed minutes from the meeting between you and the Minister of Fisheries Elisabeth Aspaker on 17 July in Malta, and the agreement between us that sedentary species in the Barents Sea, including snow crab, are subject Norwegian and Russian management competence in accordance with [Article 77 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTJna0pLS3JjUkh2S2NMUGNKSys1MlN3PT0=).*\n\n*As there is currently activity from vessels from other countries in the area, I consider it expedient that Norway and Russia will continue to act in a coordinated manner in the further work to gain acceptance for this. I would also consider it expedient if, at the forthcoming session of the joint Norwegian Russian Fisheries Commission, we discuss how the snow crab is to be managed in the future.*\n\n*I also suggest that in the period leading up to a management regime, we allow Norwegian and Russian vessels to continue the activities they currently have in Smutthullet so that we avoid disturbing the economic activities unnecessarily*.706\n\nLetter from Mr Arne Røksund, 2 August 2015 (**C-0196**).\n\n[]()\n\n475\\.\n\nThe EU reacted to this agreement by a letter to all EU Member States from the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of the European Commission ("**DG Mare**") on 5 August 2015. The letter stated:\n\n*The Commission writes to refer to the discussions in the Fishery Attaches meeting of 30 July last in relation to snow crab fisheries in the so-called "Loop Hole" of the NEAFC Regulatory Area.*\n\n*Your attention is drawn to the particular features of those waters, namely a water column that falls under the international regime of the high seas as reflected in Part VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), on the one hand, but, at the same time, waters superjacent to the extended continental shelves of Norway and the Russian Federation, which fall under part VI of UNCLOS, on the other.*\n\n*With regard to snow crab, it appears that this species is "unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil" and it thus falls within the definition of "sedentary species" of Article 77(4) of UNCLOS. The fact that snow crab falls within that definition formed the subject matter of an earlier dispute between Canada and the United States about the prosecution of snow-crab fisheries conducted by United States fishing vessels on the Canadian continental shelf at a location where Canada\'s continental shelf extended beyond 200 nautical miles in the Northwest Atlantic. At that time, the European Union (then the European Community) considered snow crab to fall within the definition of "sedentary species" and, therefore, did not lodge any protest against Canada.*\n\n*Indeed whenever the question of whether or not a crab species fell within the definition of "sedentary species" gave rise to an international dispute, e.g. the dispute between Japan and the United States about the latter\'s classification of Alaskan king crab as "sedentary species", the relevant coastal State has always prevailed in the end.*\n\n*It follows from this classification of snow crab as "sedentary species" that only the relevant coastal States, i.e. Norway and the Russian Federation, are entitled to exploit (i.e. to harvest) it by virtue of their sovereign rights under the continental shelf regime of UNCLOS and that, as spelled out in Article 77(2) of UNCLOS, no other state is able to do so unless it has obtained the coastal State\'s explicit consent. Moreover, the coastal State\'s rights are exclusive in a sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake any such activities without the express consent of the coastal state.*\n\n*Therefore, without the express consent of the relevant coastal States (namely Norway and the Russian Federation in the present instance), these fisheries are illegal as they would be in contravention of Article 77(2) of UNCLOS.*\n\n*The Commission would underline that the EU, as a Contracting Party to UNCLOS, is under an obligation to respect Article 77(2) of UNCLOS. Similarly, upon its ratification by the Union, UNCLOS forms part of the legal order of the Union pursuant to the provisions of Article 216 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, such that also the Member States are bound to respect it.*\n\n*Consequently, since both Norway and the Russian Federation have given no such consent, member States are advised that they should rescind any current licences authorising their vessels to fish for snow crab and any other sedentary species such as king crab in the NEAFC Regulatory Area and should not issue any new licences to this effect and, as appropriate, re-call the vessels concerned*.707\n\nLetter from Ms Lowri Evans, Director-General of DG Mare, to Spanish Ambassador Mr José Pascual Marco Martínez, 5 August 2015 (**R-0033**).\n\n[]()\n\n476\\.\n\nOn 30 October 2015, Norway sent a Note Verbale to the European Union explaining that Norway, the Russian Federation and Denmark had voted in the NEAFC against an EU proposal for exploratory bottom fishing activities in the Loop Hole for red king crab and snow crab and asserting the right of the coastal State to control the harvesting of sedentary species in the Loop Hole.708\n\nNote Verbale from Norway to the EU, 30 October 2015 (**C-0109**).\n\n[]()\n\n477\\.\n\nLatvia protested about these developments. In a Letter to the Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of the European Union dated 11 September 2015, Latvia stated, in response to the Norwegian Note Verbale, that it had never been questioned that Norway and the Russian Federation had delegated their rights regarding management of sedentary species in NEAFC waters to the NEAFC. Latvia requested that the EU take the following position:\n\n\\[A]*ll ambiguous issues or disputes concerning fisheries of snow crab have to be dealt within NEAFC and if any of signatory countries of the NEAFC Convention would like to suggest changes in the current procedure (e.g. introduce new regulations regarding unregulated species), the issue should be dealt with within procedures established by NEAFC*.709\n\nLetter from the Latvian Minister of Agriculture to the Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of the European Union, 11 September 2015 (**C-0108**). Latvia also protested directly to Norway: see Report of a Meeting between the Norwegian Embassy in Latvia and the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 4 November 2015 (**C-0206**).\n\n[]()\n\n478\\.\n\nLatvia also complained directly to Norway. Latvia did not revoke the licences it had issued to North Star\'s vessels and indeed renewed those licences in 2016.\n\n[]()\n\n479\\.\n\nThis record shows that, notwithstanding Norway\'s references to its longstanding and consistent position regarding the inclusion of crabs within the definition of "*sedentary species*", Norway initially treated the stock of snow crab in the Loop Hole as being in international waters and falling within the regime established by the NEAFC, which would be the case only if the snow crab was non-sedentary. That was the assumption underlying Norway\'s replies to inquiries from Mr Levanidov\'s colleagues (see paragraphs 513 to 523, below), the reference in the 2014 Regulations to the exclusive economic zone and the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone rather than the continental shelf, and Norway\'s own practice of licensing its fishing vessels to take snow crab in the Loop Hole. Moreover, when the Russian Federation raised the question in October 2014, there was initially some hesitation in the Norwegian Government regarding whether the snow crab was a sedentary species within the meaning of Article 77(4) of UNCLOS. The Tribunal does not, however, consider that Norway\'s actions can be regarded as improper or unwarranted.\n\n[]()\n\n480\\.\n\nFirst, while the Tribunal is not called upon to decide whether or not the snow crab is a sedentary species within the UNCLOS definition,710 Norway\'s conclusion that it is a sedentary species cannot be regarded as an outlier. The letter from DG Mare to the EU Member States in the wake of the Agreed Minutes of the Malta meeting makes clear that the EU Commission shared the view that snow crab meets the definition of a sedentary species and cites practice of other States to the same effect.711 The Commission\'s letter bears out Norway\'s assertion that State practice on this question supports Norway\'s view.712 It is noticeable that Latvia\'s protest concerned not whether snow crab is a sedentary species but whether Norway and Russia had delegated management powers in respect of snow crab on their extended continental shelves to the NEAFC.\n\nThe Claimants expressly deny that this is a "*live issue*" in the proceeding: Cl. Memorial, para. 598.\n\nSee paragraph 473475, above.\n\nResp. Rejoinder, para. 15.\n\n[]()\n\n481\\.\n\nSecondly, such scientific assessment as has been shown to the Tribunal tends to support the conclusion that, at the harvestable stage, snow crab "*are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed*".\n\n[]()\n\n482\\.\n\nThirdly, Norway\'s hesitation during 2014 is understandable when one considers the circumstances. Snow crab had only recently begun to appear in the Loop Hole (as the table at paragraph 8181 shows, 2014 was the first year in which commercially significant quantities were harvested) and at that stage were not believed to be present in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole, though it was thought likely that they would in time spread into that sector. It is therefore not surprising that Norwegian officials started to think about the status of snow crab only in the second half of 2014. Moreover, when they did do so, it was entirely reasonable that they sought advice about the scientific properties of the species, not least because there appears to have been another species of crab which would not have fallen within the definition in Article 77(4) of UNCLOS. That advice was unequivocal and clearly informed the preliminary assessment of the legal department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.713 At the PECCOE meeting in January 2015, Russia and Norway informed the meeting that, while they were still considering the status of the snow crab, "*it is very likely that it is to be defined as a sedentary species*".714 That Norway wanted to explore the views of other States and coordinate its action with the Russian Federation is also entirely understandable given the diplomatic situation, especially in light of the fact that, at that point in time, the snow crab was predominantly, if not exclusively, located on the Russian continental shelf.\n\nSee paragraph 469, above.\n\nSee paragraph 469471, above.\n\n[]()\n\n483\\.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not accept the Claimants\' argument that the language used in different emails and other communications show that Norway intended the "*designation*" of snow crab to be a matter for the future only. That submission confuses the question of whether snow crab is a sedentary species — a question of law which, if answered in the affirmative, cannot be limited to the future — with the issue of regulation of harvesting of snow crab. Since neither Russia nor Norway had in place regulations for harvesting snow crab in their outer continental shelves at the date of the Malta Declaration, reference to regulation and a management programme were necessarily in the future tense.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***c. Measures Taken by the Russian Federation***\n\n[]()\n\n484\\.\n\nAn important element of the Claimants\' case, which cuts across different claims, is the allegation that Norway incited the Russian Federation to assert sovereign rights over snow crab in the Loop Hole, or conspired with the Russian Federation to exclude EU crabbers. As counsel for the Claimants put it at the Hearing:\n\n*Which brings me to my last point about what this case, our merits case, is not about. It\'s not about harm caused by Russian measures that Norway was powerless to prevent. It\'s not about that at all. It\'s an attractive temptation perhaps, in this day and age, to blame the world\'s ills on the Russian Federation, but that\'s just not the evidence at all.*\n\n*What the evidence on this topic is, is that it was Norway who was the instigator of the idea that the coastal States should begin asserting sovereign rights over snow crab in the NEAFC area which was a sharp reversal of the prior approach that this fishery was open to vessels flagged in any NEAFC Member State*. \\[…]715\n\nTranscript, Day 4, p. 72, lines 8-20 (Ms Seers).\n\n[]()\n\n485\\.\n\nWhile counsel for the Claimants maintained that "*Norway is not responsible for the actions of the Russian Federation*", she went on to assert that "*Norway is responsible for what Norway does in reaction to the actions of others*".716\n\nTranscript, Day 4, p. 78, lines 2-4 (Ms Seers).\n\n[]()\n\n486\\.\n\nThe Tribunal has already explained, in its discussion of the *Monetary Gold* principle (see paragraphs 294 to 295, above), that, while that principle does not preclude it from exercising jurisdiction in the present case, it does circumscribe what the Tribunal can decide. It is not open to the Tribunal to decide whether or not the Russian Federation was in breach of international law. However, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to delve deeper into the ramifications of *Monetary Gold*, because the record simply does not support the proposition that Norway was the "*instigator of the idea that the coastal States should begin asserting sovereign rights over snow crab in the NEAFC area*".\n\n[]()\n\n487\\.\n\nAs the Norwegian reports of the meeting in October 2014 of the Joint Norway-Russian Federation Fisheries Commission (quoted in paragraph 461463, above) indicates, it appears to have been the Russian Federation which first raised the issue of whether snow crab was a resource covered by the regime of the outer continental shelf. It was that which prompted the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries to seek legal advice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on whether the snow crab met the UNCLOS definition of a sedentary species.\n\n[]()\n\n488\\.\n\nSince, at that time, most of the snow crab in the Loop Hole was believed to be in the Russian sector, Norway recognized that it was for the Russian Federation to take the lead.717 Norway planned to "*lie low*" in any NEAFC discussion in late 2014 and see what Russia did.\n\nSee paragraph 472, above.\n\n[]()\n\n489\\.\n\nIt is true that, in the Norwegian record of a later meeting between the Russian Federation and Norway in September 2015, it is recorded that "\\[t]*he Russian side was concerned about the handling of snow crab in the NEAFC area and concerns that unregulated fishing could mean that some countries acquired fishing rights*".718 It is also the case that Russia did not adopt regulations banning the harvesting of snow crab by foreign vessels in its sector of the Loop Hole until almost nine months after Norway had adopted the 2015 Regulations banning such activity in its sector of the Loop Hole. In July 2016, a Norwegian report of a bilateral meeting, held in the wings of the North Atlantic Fisheries Ministers Conference, stated that the Russian Minister had informed his Norwegian counterpart that "*the Russian Coast Guard cannot perform enforcement, as the fishing takes place outside the 200-mile zone*" and asked that the Norwegians ban the landing in Norway of snow crab taken on the Russian outer continental shelf. Norway responded that it could not act until Russia banned snow crab harvesting on its extended continental shelf.719\n\nReport from the Norwegian Fisheries and Acquaculture Department to the Minister of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, 29 September 2015 (**C-0201**), p. 2.\n\nReport of the Minister of Trade, Industry and Fisheries on the 2016 North Atlantic Fisheries Ministerial Conference and Bilateral Meetings (**C-0207**), pp. 2-3.\n\n[]()\n\n490\\.\n\nThe Tribunal does not read these exchanges as confirming the Claimants\' view that Norway instigated the Russian ban. Not only was it Russia which first raised the issue of exercising continental shelf rights with regard to snow crab in the Loop Hole, the Russian concern about acquired rights was understandable given that it was on the Russian continental shelf that most of the harvesting in the Loop Hole had taken place between 2014 and 2016. Moreover, it was Russia which tried to persuade Norway to introduce a landing ban, something which Norway understandably said could not be done in respect of crab which had been lawfully taken on the Russian continental shelf. Russia\'s reference to its coast guard being unable to act reflected the fact that, at the time that comment was made, Russia had not legislated to ban taking of snow crab in the outer continental shelf.\n\n[]()\n\n491\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimants\' argument that Norway had incited the Russian ban. It also rejects the conspiracy argument. There is no evidence that would suggest anything like a conspiracy between the two States. The Tribunal has already concluded that the determination that snow crab is a sedentary species within the meaning of Article 77(4) of UNCLOS was in no way unwarranted or improper. The question whether what followed that determination was an arbitrary act or was carried out in bad faith is considered below.\n\n[]()\n\n492\\.\n\nThe Tribunal has already held (see paragraphs 265 to 267, above) that, until the Russian ban was introduced in September 2016, North Star\'s harvesting of snow crab occurred almost entirely in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. It has also rejected the Claimants\' argument that the Russian sector of the Loop Hole must be regarded, for the purposes of Article I(4) of the BIT, as Norwegian territory (see paragraphs 263 to 264, above).\n\n[]()\n\n493\\.\n\nThe real damage to North Star (and, by extension, to Sea &amp; Coast) came about as a result of the September 2016 Russian ban on foreign vessels taking snow crab in the Russian part of the Loop Hole. While Norway understandably maintained close contact with Russia in relation to the snow crab stock in the Loop Hole, Norway cannot be held responsible for the actions of the Russian Federation. To the extent that it was the Russian action which caused the Claimants\' loss, there has been no breach of the BIT and there can be no compensation in these proceedings.\n\n[]()\n\n494\\.\n\nNor is the Tribunal persuaded by the Claimants\' alternative argument that Norway\'s response to the Russian measures amounted to a breach of the BIT, so that Norway incurred liability for losses resulting from North Star\'s vessels being excluded from the Russian continental shelf in the Loop Hole.720 The Tribunal can see no reason why Norway had an obligation to North Star to protect it from Russia\'s action (or, indeed, how Norway might have done so). Nor does the Tribunal consider that Norway\'s obligations under the BIT required it to take steps to ameliorate the consequences of that action.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, p. 79, line 18 to p. 80, line 4 (Ms Seers).\n\n[]()\n\n495\\.\n\nIt follows that the Claimants can succeed only if they can show that Norway\'s own actions in respect of their investments (as those investments have been defined in paragraphs 238 240 to 287289, above) violated the BIT and, if they can do that, they can recover damages only in respect of any losses which can be shown to have been caused by Norway\'s actions and not by those of the Russian Federation.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***d.

The Tribunal agrees that this is an additional requirement not found in all other BITs. The Claimants rely upon it in support of their argument that Norway should have protected their investment from the effects of the introduction by the Russian Federation of a ban on harvesting snow crab in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. For the reasons given in paragraphs 492 to 494, above, the Tribunal considers that claim unsustainable.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(ii) The violations alleged by the Claimants***\n\n[]()\n\n501\\.\n\nThe Claimants allege five violations which they advance both separately and cumulatively:-\n\n(i) that Norway acted arbitrarily;\n\n(ii) that Norway acted in bad faith;\n\n(iii) that Norway acted in disregard of the legitimate expectations of the Claimants;\n\n(iv) that Norway acted without the requisite transparency and consistency; and\n\n(v) that Norway committed a denial of justice.\n\n[]()\n\n502\\.\n\nThe allegation of denial of justice arises in respect of the Svalbard claims and will be considered there. In addition, North Star argues that Norway violated the obligation under Article III to encourage investments of Latvian investors in its territory. While that allegation affects both the Loop Hole claims and the Svalbard claims, it arises in particular in connection with Svalbard and the Tribunal will therefore consider it in Section V.B(4), below.\n\n[]()\n\n503\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants\' arguments regarding the other four alleged violations are closely bound up together and that the Claimants\' assertions regarding what they claim were their legitimate expectations are at the heart of these allegations. The Tribunal will therefore begin by analysing that part of the Claimants\' case.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(iii) Legitimate expectations***\n\n[]()\n\n504\\.\n\nThere is no doubt that the concept of respect for legitimate expectations is an important part of the standard of fair and equitable or equitable and reasonable treatment.728 As the tribunal in *Lemire v.

However, the Tribunal does not accept that an investor has a general legitimate expectation that the law affecting the investment will remain unchanged. The Tribunal agrees with the observation of the tribunal in *EDF v. Romania*:\n\n*The idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore* \\[fair and equitable treatment], *imply the stability of the legal and business framework, may not be correct if stated in an overly-broad and unqualified formulation. The* \\[fair and equitable treatment] *might then mean the virtual freezing of the legal regulation of economic activities, in contrast with the State\'s normal regulatory power and the evolutionary character of economic life. Except where specific promises or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State\'s legal and economic framework.

No question of State support arose here. Nor did Norway sell permits for exploitation of snow crab. The issue concerns the imposition of a ban on harvesting snow crab where previously one had not existed.\n\n[]()\n\n508\\.\n\nIt is also necessary to bear in mind the chronology. Although both Parties speak about long-held assumptions, the fact is that snow crab was a recent arrival in the Barents Sea. As the Tribunal has already held (see paragraphs 81 to 82, above), it was not until 2013 that significant quantities of snow crab were harvested in the Barents Sea and throughout the period until September 2016, snow crab were taken almost entirely from Russian waters and the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. While the Norwegian Government was aware that snow crab were migrating westwards and would thus probably become common in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole, until well into 2016 there appears to have been no significant harvesting of snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole. There was, therefore, no particular reason for Norway to have taken a position about banning or regulating such harvesting until comparatively late in the day.\n\n[]()\n\n509\\.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the absence of any Norwegian legislation regarding the harvesting of snow crab by foreign vessels in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole before December 2015 could not, in itself, have given rise to a legitimate expectation that there would be no such legislation banning or restricting that activity in the future. Accordingly, it rejects the claim that there was a legitimate expectation of a general character.\n\n[]()\n\n510\\.\n\nOf course, such a legitimate expectation could have arisen from specific statements, actions or undertakings given by Norway. The Claimants maintain that they did indeed have such a legitimate expectation as a result of Norway\'s statements and actions, the fishing licences and fishing capacity which they were granted and the actions of the EU and NEAFC.\n\n[]()\n\n511\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the fishing licences and fishing capacity are irrelevant to the question whether the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that they would be allowed to harvest snow crab in the Loop Hole. Only the actions and statements of Norway, or of another body acting on behalf of Norway, could give rise to a legitimate expectation on which the Claimants could rely as against Norway. The fishing licences were granted by Latvia and fishing capacity by the EU (of which Norway is not a Member State). Neither could therefore create a legitimate expectation regarding the treatment by Norway of an investment by the Claimants. Similarly, Norway\'s statements and actions could not give rise to a legitimate expectation that the Claimants could take snow crab in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole.\n\n[]()\n\n512\\.\n\nThe position is different as regards the NEAFC, since Norway is a member of that organization. However, the Tribunal does not accept that the actions of the NEAFC as regards harvesting snow crab in the Loop Hole gave rise to a legitimate expectation that Norway would not in future ban or limit the taking of snow crab in its portion of the Loop Hole. The fact that the NEAFC had not regulated snow crab in 2014 did not imply that Norway would not impose regulation in the future. First, the reference to regulated and unregulated species in the NEAFC context refers only to whether the NEAFC had fixed a quota for the species. Secondly, the NEAFC has no authority to do more than recommend measures in respect of an area under national jurisdiction. The continental shelf in the Norwegian part of the Loop Hole is under Norwegian jurisdiction and no recommendation could therefore have been made regarding sedentary species there without Norway\'s request and support. No such recommendation was ever made and EU proposals to approve experimental harvesting were rejected in the NEAFC. Lastly, NEAFC rules regarding *how* catches were made did not imply authority to make such catches.\n\n[]()\n\n513\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to the different statements and actions of Norway itself. These have already been summarised in Sections II.C to II.E, above. They are, however, of such importance that it is necessary to set them out in greater detail. Most of them are responses to inquiries by Mr Levanidov or his representative. Norway highlights the fact that they were not made directly to either Claimant. The Tribunal accepts that but considers that the relationship between Mr Levanidov and Mr Pildegovics was such that it may be assumed that the latter was made aware of those responses.\n\n[]()\n\n514\\.\n\nThe responses are frequently in the form of brief emails and it is important that these are seen in the context of the inquiries to which they replied.\n\n[]()\n\n515\\.\n\nThe first such communication was in May 2013. On 9 May 2013, Mr Ankipov, then the CEO of Ishavsbruket and later the founder of Sea &amp; Coast, emailed Mr Sigmund Hågensen, the Section Chief of the Directorate of Fisheries of the Finnmark Region of Norway:\n\n*We are a company called Ishavsbruket AS and located in Båtsfjord and currently we are working on investigating a topic regarding snow crab and in this regard there are some questions that we would like to ask you.*\n\n*1.

What applies to e.g. Norwegian fishing vessels in both NØS and Spitsberg\'s zone, which Norwegian fishing vessels can catch snow crab in NØS and in Spitsberg, are there any restrictions, possibly special permits for catching, type of vessel???*\n\n*We need the above information to support this project.*734\n\n**KL-0016** \\[emphasis in the original].\n\n[]()\n\n516\\.\n\nMr Hågensen replied on 16 May 2013:\n\n*1. Russian vessels cannot catch snow crab in the NØS / Svalbard zone. This is because the snow crab is not a part of the fisheries agreement between Russia and Norway. The same applies to other foreign vessels.*\n\n*2. Catching of snow crab is unregulated. Norwegian fishing vessels (i.e. vessels entered in the Norwegian Register of Fishing Vessels (Merkeregisteret) can fish for this species in the NØS / Svalbard zone. If Norwegian vessels are to catch snow crab in international waters, they must be registered for fishing in the NEAFC area*.735\n\n**KL-0016** \\[emphasis in the original].\n\n[]()\n\n517\\.\n\nMr Ankipov then forwarded this exchange to Mr Levanidov.\n\n[]()\n\n518\\.\n\nThis exchange says nothing about EU vessels taking snow crab anywhere. The reference to "*fishing in the NEAFC area*" was in reply to a question about Norwegian fishing vessels. While the Claimants maintain that the second sentence of the second paragraph is broader and suggests that Mr Hågensen considered snow crab to be a non-sedentary species, the Tribunal considers that far too slender a reed on which to build a legitimate expectation regarding the right of a type of vessel not mentioned in the exchange to take snow crab in the Norwegian part of the Loop Hole.\n\n[]()\n\n519\\.\n\nOn 7 June 2013, Mr Ankipov emailed Ms Hilde Jensen of the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries:\n\n*I have been in contact with Sigmund Hågensen regarding a question concerning the NEAFC register* \\[…]*.*\n\n*We have a question regarding the NEAFC area. How should registration take place?*\n\n*This applies for fishing for snow crab in the area.*\n\n*It would be good if you could describe this process for registration and how long it takes to obtain registrations*?736\n\n**R-0095**.\n\n[]()\n\n520\\.\n\nMs Jensen replied on 12 June 2013:\n\n*The attached regulations for registration and reporting when fishing in waters outside any state\'s fisheries jurisdiction are sent for information.*\n\n*As stated in § 2, vessels that are to fish in waters outside any state\'s fisheries jurisdiction must be registered through notification to the Directorate of Fisheries.

It is true that, as the Claimants maintain, the response did not make clear that foreign vessels had no right to harvest crab on the Norwegian continental shelf without Norwegian authorization,739 but that was not the question raised and the response simply does not address that question. The response speaks of fishing and of waters outside the jurisdiction of a State and the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this was how Norwegian officials saw the matter at the time, but this was a technical exchange relating to registration requirements and it would be wrong to read much into it.\n\nCl. Reply, para. 647.\n\n[]()\n\n523\\.\n\nThe next communications were between Mr Ankipov and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority in February 2014. On 5 February 2014, Mr Sofus Olsen of the Authority responded to an inquiry from Mr Ankipov which Mr Olsen summarised as "*whether EU-registered boats are free to deliver crab to approved crab receptions in accordance with our regulations*" and answered "*EU-registered fishing boats can deliver crab freely to Norwegian crab receptions. If the fishing is quota-regulated (king crab, for example), the boats must have a quota*".740 This exchange relates to the landing of crabs and says nothing about their harvesting.\n\nEmail exchanges between Mr Sergei Ankipov Mr Sofus Olsen of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, 3-5 February 2014 (**KL-0019)**.\n\n[]()\n\n524\\.\n\nOn 20 July 2014, Mr Ankipov wrote to the Section Chief of the Directorate of Fisheries of the Finnmark region regarding "*the information that is relevant for EU vessels that will fish snow crab in the NEAFC area*". The relevant part of the email stated:\n\n*This is a project where a fishing vessel under the EU flag will land live snow crabs at approved Norwegian reception stations (factories). Please describe or present the process regarding the documents to be sent to the Directorate of Fisheries in this case*.741\n\n**KL-0020**.\n\n[]()\n\n525\\.\n\nThe reply, sent on 25 July 2014, read:\n\n*Basically this corresponds to matters concerning the regulations of the Fisheries Administration. Regulations issued by other agencies, such as the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Råfiklaget etc. must be clarified to these agencies.*\n\n*1. In principle, EU vessels can land fish, including snow crab to Norway on an equal footing with Norwegian fishing vessels. There are therefore no other rules for EU vessels when it comes to fresh and live goods. All registered buyers in Finnmark have a good overview of the conditions for landing.*\n\n*2. In principle, no special documentation shall be submitted to the fisheries authorities when the crab is to be landed alive at a Norwegian reception centre, and the crab has been caught outside the Norwegian Economic Zone*.\n\n*3. The catch shall be landed to the buyer who is registered with the Directorate of Fisheries\' Register of Buyers. Regulations on the duty to provide information:* \\[internet link] *determines the procedures for landing.*\n\n*4. If the vessel is to deliver frozen products, this must be reported 24 hours in advance in accordance with the regulations on fishing by foreigners....* \\[internet link]. *Vessels that are to fish in the Norwegian Economic Zone are also subject to reporting according to the same regulations. As the activity is described, it does not fall under these regulations.*\n\n*According to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, it should also be okay to land live crabs at Norwegian reception centres.*742\n\n**KL-0020**.\n\n[]()\n\n526\\.\n\nNorway maintains that this email relates only to landing not harvesting of snow crab. That is true but the Tribunal does not consider that it put Mr Ankipov on notice that there might be a need for authorization for EU vessels to take snow crab in the Loop Hole. On the contrary, the assumption of both correspondents appears to have been that there was no such requirement and, indeed, until December 2015 there were no Norwegian regulations prohibiting the taking of snow crab in the Loop Hole.\n\n[]()\n\n527\\.\n\nNevertheless, the critical point is that nothing in any of the correspondence suggests, let alone undertakes, that Norway might not introduce restrictions, or even a ban, on the taking of snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole. The Claimants are correct when they say that in none of the exchanges with Norwegian officials did anyone warn that there might be a change in regulations, but that is not at all the same as an assurance that there would be no such change and it is an assurance of that kind that is required to give rise to a specific legitimate expectation. Moreover, it has to be remembered that, at the time that the correspondence took place, the focus was on the Russian sector of the Loop Hole, the much larger area in which snow crab were then concentrated. The Tribunal considers that the correspondence is nowhere near sufficient to create a legitimate expectation that Norway would not change its law.\n\n[]()\n\n528\\.\n\nThe same is true of the practice on which the Claimants rely. The fact that Norwegian government ships inspected North Star\'s vessels and that Norway accepted North Star\'s NEAFC PSC forms without inquiring whether the crab in question had been caught in the Norwegian or the Russian sector of the Loop Hole has to be viewed in light of the fact that the great majority of snow crab caught in the Loop Hole at the relevant times was caught in the Russian sector. The fact that there are no prosecutions in Norway of EU vessels for fishing in the Loop Hole during the first six months of 2016 does not imply that Norway "*systematically \'accepted\' that EU vessels holding NEAFC licences issued by EU Member States could catch snow crabs in the Loop Hole*".743 At the relevant time, most harvesting of snow crab was still taking place in the Russian sector, where there was no ban to enforce. That Norway did not more aggressively enforce its 2015 Regulations in its own sector of the Loop Hole is understandable in view of the difficulty of determining whether a catch had taken place there or in the Russian sector. It was certainly not enough to give rise to a legitimate expectation that North Star would be permitted to take snow crab from the Norwegian sector where, until then, it had been largely inactive.\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 743.\n\n[]()\n\n529\\.\n\nFinally, there are the actions of the Mayor of Båtsfjord and visiting ministers and parliamentarians to Båtsfjord which the Claimants maintain showed positive encouragement for the "joint venture".744 The Tribunal does not consider that these sustain the Claimants\' argument that they gave rise to a legitimate expectation that North Star\'s vessels, which it had already acquired, would be permitted to harvest snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole. Not only did they take place after the investment had already been made and at a time when North Star\'s activities were concentrated in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole, their character was not such as to justify a legitimate expectation that Norwegian law relating to the Norwegian sector would not change.\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 742.\n\n[]()\n\n530\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimants\' argument that they had a legitimate expectation that Norway would permit them to take snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole after June 2016.\n\n[]()\n\n531\\.\n\nAlthough separate from the argument about legitimate expectations, the Claimants\' argument that they had an acquired right to take snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole fails for similar reasons. Even if the period of time in which North Star\'s vessels were engaged in taking snow crab in the Loop Hole was sufficient to give rise to an acquired right, the fact remains that, with minimal exceptions, North Star did not take snow crab in the Norwegian sector. The fact that it was extensively engaged in taking snow crab in the Russian part of the Loop Hole could not give rise to an acquired right to take snow crab in the Norwegian sector once the crab had migrated there.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(iv) Arbitrariness and bad faith***\n\n[]()\n\n532\\.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the Claimants\' related arguments that Norway\'s actions were arbitrary and were not performed in good faith. Both arguments have two separate strands: first, that Norway acted arbitrarily and in bad faith in determining that snow crab is a sedentary species; and, secondly, that Norway acted arbitrarily and in bad faith in introducing and maintaining the ban on EU vessels taking snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole.\n\n[]()\n\n533\\.\n\nThe standard of what constitutes arbitrary behaviour was authoritatively stated by the International Court of Justice in the ELSI case:\n\n*Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law as something opposed to the rule of law.* \\[…] *It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety*.745\n\n[*ELSI* (**CL-0288**), para. 128](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/SzVTbmZmeDF0eVJ1ZUJWUHVXUlpxMEs2KzY1U1ZnZmlweTVWM3BNaTJqTnpIK2ZtRWlrTW8vOWpWU3d4Mlg1QmV5WlNHeUwrckdLWDFMdmRlZzVFdDFDanphbGxDd1NQSDdWMytFeVhkalNhUWFrSVRkNzJXTGNMWFlWbG9IYkZhemhpaGxhMkRia3dWV3N3Yk5uT1JyWHZaNlN0REN3WEtpZTc5dEpIcS84PQ==).\n\n[]()\n\n534\\.\n\nThe duty to act in good faith in the exercise of a State\'s power is expressly provided for in Article 300 of UNCLOS, which provides:\n\n*States Parties shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed under this Convention and shall exercise the rights, jurisdiction and freedoms recognized in this Convention in a manner which would not constitute an abuse of right*.746\n\n**CL-0013**.\n\n[]()\n\n535\\.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that a similar duty exists as a matter of customary law.747\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 710; Cl. Reply, para. 634.\n\n[]()\n\n536\\.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that Norway\'s treatment of the status of snow crab was arbitrary or that it demonstrated a lack of good faith. As the Tribunal has already determined (see paragraphs 455 to 457, above), whether snow crab is a sedentary species is a matter of law, namely whether or not it falls within the definition in Article 77(4) of UNCLOS, and is not dependent upon "designation" by a coastal State. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that snow crab has generally been treated as falling within that definition. It is particularly noticeable that, following the Malta Declaration, the EU\'s notice to Member States accepted without question that snow crab is a sedentary species.748\n\nLetter from Ms Lowri Evans, Director-General of DG Mare, to Spanish Ambassador Mr José Pascual Marco Martínez, 5 August 2015 (**R-0033**) (see paragraph 475, above).\n\n[]()\n\n537\\.\n\nNor can Norway be faulted for the procedure which it followed. As set out in paragraphs 458460 to 472474, above, Norway\'s Fisheries Directorate and Foreign Ministry sought and obtained both scientific and legal advice before reaching the conclusion that snow crab is sedentary. While the Tribunal does not accept Norway\'s argument that it always treated the answer to the question whether or not snow crab came within the definition in UNCLOS Article 77(4) as "*blindingly obvious*", given the time it took to assess the matter in 2014 to 2015, the fact remains that the scientific and legal advice which it took was eventually categorical in concluding that snow crab was sedentary and that was in line with general international practice.\n\n[]()\n\n538\\.\n\nSince snow crab was a recent arrival in the Barents Sea and was only gradually migrating into Norwegian waters, it is not really surprising and is certainly not a matter for criticism that Norway took some time to assess the status of the snow crab. In these circumstances, it is impossible to characterise Norway\'s determination that snow crab is a sedentary species as being either arbitrary or taken in bad faith.\n\n[]()\n\n539\\.\n\nThat leaves the question whether, once Norway had concluded that snow crab is sedentary, its action in imposing a ban on taking snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole was arbitrary or amounted to a lack of good faith within the meaning of Article 300 of UNCLOS or customary international law. The Tribunal does not accept that that was the case.\n\n[]()\n\n540\\.\n\nThere are two grounds on which the Claimants seek to impugn Norway\'s actions: that they were contrary to assurances given before the Claimants made their investment and that Norway acted for improper reasons. The Tribunal has already rejected the first ground (see paragraphs 508 to 528, above).\n\n[]()\n\n541\\.\n\nWith regard to the second ground, the Tribunal accepts that a State which uses a power that it possesses for an extraneous, improper purpose may be considered to have acted arbitrarily and in abusive or bad faith manner. As the tribunal in *Tecmed v. Mexico* put it:\n\n*Upon making its investment, the fair expectations of the Claimant were that the Mexican laws applicable to such investment, as well as the supervision, control, prevention and punitive powers granted to the authorities in charge of managing such system, would be used for the purpose of assuring compliance with environmental protection, human health and ecological balance goals underlying such laws*.749\n\n[*Tecmed v. Mexico* (**CL-0252**), para. 157](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/dzZYY3RyazY5STlFZEFBWUlJczhsRzBOQVdVeUM1NlZDamdKaWMrMUtkbzY3YURjZnhzcmRobWE4M2g5S1BZRTNaWHE5Q0tZVjZxVXJOUTBiVnlBd2R5alNaL2hrUi9vNCtsdjB1SlhjbFdCYWE5dm5DditLOVAyejJvMTVocmNtUm1LbjJiMmg3bDl0Y21Mcm5kNW5RPT0=).\n\n[]()\n\n542\\.\n\nIt is essential, however, to be clear what is the purpose of the power which the State is accused of exercising improperly. In the case of the powers of the coastal State over the resources of the continental shelf, [Articles 77(1) and (2) of UNCLOS](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/QU40cHZUZkJRUURFNUNJWUNndHJFdFdrdHhZSWZBTE04d2NyNTNwTzd2VVhDRmFQRUE2emZzakovTE42RUhHTDRwUUJqaGZwei9GR0dUcHA5VkJTTWQ1MjJkbnd5Q2o5Y0t1VjYvbkdaMlMrNDRtWEtTUnVqWVdvODBCZ3luQTJtaHdBL3lxUjdJRjdRM25LdS90cXFnPT0=) make clear that those rights are conferred for the purpose of enabling the coastal State to enjoy the benefit of the resources of the continental shelf:\n\n*1. The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.*\n\n*2. The rights referred to in paragraph 1 are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake those activities without the express consent of the coastal State.750*\n\n**CL-0013**.\n\n[]()\n\n543\\.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that Norway acted in order to exclude the EU vessels harvesting snow crab on its continental shelf and reserve the resource for its own fishing industry, but that is exactly what Article 77 provides for. There is nothing extraneous or improper in Norway acting in this way. Nor is there anything wrong with it using its sovereign rights as a bargaining chip with the EU which has done the same in relation to marine resources in the continental shelves and EEZs of its Member States.\n\n[]()\n\n544\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimants\' argument that Norway has acted arbitrarily or in bad faith.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(v) Transparency and consistency***\n\n[]()\n\n545\\.\n\nTo a large extent the Claimants\' allegation that Norway displayed a lack of the transparency and consistency impliedly required by the duty of equitable and reasonable treatment recycles the arguments about legitimate expectations and arbitrariness and fails for the same reasons, as explained above. The Tribunal will, therefore, be brief in addressing this part of the Claimants\' case.\n\n[]()\n\n546\\.\n\nThe Tribunal has already held that Norway did change its position regarding taking snow crab in the Loop Hole but that there was nothing improper or unwarranted either in the fact that it did so, or in the manner in which it reached its decision. The Tribunal has also held that the Claimants were not entitled to expect that there would be no change in the regulation of snow crab harvesting.\n\n[]()\n\n547\\.\n\nAlthough the Claimants assert that "*in July 2015 Norway proceeded to re-characterize snow crabs as a \'sedentary species\' despite decades of practice to the contrary*",751 there were no such decades of practice. There is no evidence that Norway took any position about snow crab — or that it needed to do so — until snow crab started to be harvested commercially in the Barents Sea. Norwegian practice is limited to the period from 2013.\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 747.\n\n[]()\n\n548\\.\n\nEven then, the stock of snow crab was almost entirely located in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole and in Russian waters to the north-east. Norway\'s practice in allowing the landing of snow crab caught in the Russian sector at a time when Russia had no ban on taking snow crab in that sector is not in any way inconsistent with Norway\'s actions in enacting and then enforcing a ban on the taking of snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole. Nor did allowing such landings amount to Norway giving "*express consent to snow crab fishing activities by EU vessels in the Loop Hole*".752\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 749.\n\n[]()\n\n549\\.\n\nThe Claimants criticise the quotas for taking snow crab which Norway has adopted since 2016 as too low and environmentally inappropriate, based on the Expert Report of Dr Kaiser. That is not a matter on which the Tribunal needs to opine. Even if that criticism was justified, it would not amount to a breach of the duty of consistency and transparency under Article III of the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n550\\.\n\nFinally, the Claimants maintain that there was a smear campaign against them in a Norwegian newspaper and false allegations by a Norwegian prosecutor. The Tribunal does not consider this part of the Claimants\' case to be sustained by the evidence and it is, in any event, irrelevant to the issues which arise under Article III of the BIT. There is no evidence that the allegations or the press reports influenced, or were affected by, the Norwegian decisions regarding harvesting snow crab.\n\n[]()\n\n551\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the claim that Norway displayed a lack of consistency or transparency such as would rise to the level of a violation of Article III of the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***(vi) Conclusion***\n\n[]()\n\n552\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects North Sea\'s Loop Hole claims that it has been the victim of a violation of Article III of the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***e.

Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party cannot be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to other measures having a similar effect (all such measures hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") except when the following conditions are fulfilled:*\n\n*(i) The expropriation shall be done for public interest and under domestic legal procedures;*\n\n*(ii) It shall not be discriminatory;*\n\n*(iii) It shall be done only against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.753*\n\n**CL-0001**.\n\n[]()\n\n554\\.\n\nThe Parties are agreed that this provision is not confined to cases of formal nationalization or outright taking but includes so-called "*indirect expropriation*". There is also broad agreement that the concept of indirect expropriation was summed up in the following passage from the award in *Metalclad v. Mexico*:\n\n\\[E]*xpropriation* \\[…] *includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State*.754\n\n[*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000 (**CL-0260**), para. 103](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/bjRaQjZiWEF1OHczN0gzZXREb1RPeEhmU0puV0xMYTMrVTRLUUVCWEpPSGF6SDhmWTVkejN5Y2UzeG5OVGhKSFlPOG9PbmpGaEU1QTQwRTNXZ2FrR3Y1WUV6SENJWWxGRjVjUFhtWml4eFpzR3g1YXJJOW9GK21PSFBQT0lWTFQ4RVVlYjZ5eWx5Q0Z3OGtsR1R3UUFRPT0=).\n\n[]()\n\n555\\.\n\nIn applying this test to the facts of the present case, the Tribunal considers that it is necessary to begin by recalling three findings which it has already made. First, the Tribunal has held that the only investment which North Star had made in the territory of Norway was the entitlement to contractual performance of an agreement that Seagourmet would purchase such snow crab as the former offered for sale up to the limit of Seagourmet\'s capacity at its Båtsfjord plant (see paragraphs 258 to 282, above). The question, therefore, is whether Norway\'s actions could be said to amount to indirect expropriation of *this* investment.\n\n[]()\n\n556\\.\n\nSecondly, the evidence shows that throughout the period from January 2015 to September 2016,755 North Star\'s catch of snow crab came almost entirely from the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. During the first eight months of 2016, when the ban introduced by Norway in the 2015 Regulations prohibited EU vessels from taking snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole, North Star was able to operate profitably. It was the introduction of the Russian ban on 3 September 2016 which put a stop to the majority of North Star\'s activities in the Loop Hole; had that ban not been introduced, there is no reason to believe that North Star would have been unable to take snow crab in the quantities it had been taking in the first part of 2016 or that it would have been unable to land them and sell them to Seagourmet. The Tribunal has already found (see paragraphs 484 to 495, above) that Norway cannot be held responsible for the measures taken by the Russian Federation. It follows that the Claimants\' claim for expropriation can succeed only if they can establish that the measures taken by Norway, as opposed to those taken by the Russian Federation, amounted to indirect expropriation of the investment identified above.\n\nSee paragraphs 263 to 265, above. Prior to January 2015, there was only one landing of snow crab by North Star and that was sold to a different processing plant: see Transcript, Day 2, p. 26, line 21 to p. 27, line 11 (Mr Pildegovics).\n\n[]()\n\n557\\.\n\nThirdly, in advancing their expropriation claim, the Claimants argue that *Metalclad v. Mexico*, and other awards on indirect expropriation,756 support a submission that expropriation can result from "*the vitiation of an investor\'s legitimate expectations*" and cite the *Tecmed v. Mexico* award as finding that the *"repudiation of the investor\'s legitimate expectation of an economic return on its investment*" could constitute an indirect expropriation.757 Norway disputes that these awards sustain those propositions but even if they did, the Tribunal recalls that it has already rejected the Claimants\' argument that they had a legitimate expectation of being able to take snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole (see paragraphs 502 to 528, above). Similarly, the Tribunal has rejected the Claimants\' contentions that Norway acted arbitrarily, without sound basis under UNCLOS or for improper purposes in determining that snow crab is a sedentary species and then banning EU vessels from taking snow crab on the Norwegian outer continental shelf (see paragraphs 532 to 544, above).\n\nThe Claimants rely in particular on the awards in [*Antoine Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd. v.

Memorial, para. 684.\n\n[]()\n\n558\\.\n\nAccordingly, even if the Tribunal were to accept the very broad definition of indirect expropriation advanced by the Claimants, the expropriation claim would fail.\n\n[]()\n\n559\\.\n\nNorth Star\'s investment in the territory of Norway was restricted to a claim to performance under an unwritten contract with Seagourmet that the latter would buy snow crab from North Star.\n\n[]()\n\n560\\.\n\nThe precise extent and value of the claim to performance is extremely difficult to determine. There appears to have been no agreement as to the quantity of snow crab which North Star would sell and Seagourmet purchase until the first written contracts between them were concluded in late 2016 and in 2017. In cross-examination, Mr Pildegovics said that there had been no need for a written agreement until late 2016.758 The Tribunal finds that statement strange, to say the least. Throughout 2015 and the first eight months of 2016, North Star was delivering substantial quantities of snow crab to Seagourmet. The need for a written agreement about how much would be delivered in the future only appeared at the time when the Claimants maintain it was already clear that North Star would not be able to harvest *any* snow crab in the Loop Hole and thus would not be able to make any deliveries to Seagourmet.759\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 144, lines 6-15 (Mr Pildegovics).\n\nNorth Star\'s plan to redeploy at least part of its fleet to the waters off Svalbard is considered below but North Star must have realized that Norway would not permit it to take snow crab there since doing so had been prohibited ever since the 2014 Regulations had entered into force at the beginning of 2015.\n\n[]()\n\n561\\.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal is prepared to accept that North Star had a claim to performance, albeit of undefined scope and value, of an unwritten agreement to deliver snow crab to Seagourmet which would buy it at the market price so long as the quantity did not exceed the capacity of the processing facility at Båtsfjord. Once North Star was unable to take snow crab, that claim to performance effectively lost its economic value. However, what caused it to lose its economic value was the action of the Russian Federation in banning the harvesting of snow cab in the Russian sector of the Loop Hole. Had the Russian Federation not taken that action, there is no evidence that North Star would not have been able to continue delivering large quantities of snow crab to Seagourmet. Norway did not prohibit the landing of snow crab lawfully taken in the Russian sector even after Norway had banned EU crabbers from taking snow crab in the Norwegian sector.\n\n[]()\n\n562\\.\n\nThe Claimants\' response is that Norway could, and should, have allowed them to harvest snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole. However, the Tribunal has already held that the Claimants had no legitimate expectation of being allowed to take snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole.760 It has also rejected the argument (advanced rather tentatively at the Hearing) that Norway\'s obligation under Article III of the BIT to protect North Star\'s investment obliged it to respond to Russia\'s actions by opening up its own part of the Loop Hole.761\n\nSee paragraphs 522 to 528, above.\n\nSee paragraph 492, above.\n\n[]()\n\n563\\.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make clear, however, that it does not accept the Claimants\' submission about the broad scope of indirect expropriation. It agrees with Norway that the awards on which the Claimants rely do not support that submission. In *Metalclad v. Mexico*, the claimant\'s project to build and operate a hazardous waste plant required, and had been granted, express authorization by the federal government only to be halted by the refusal of a municipal permit in circumstances which the tribunal held exceeded the authority of the municipality.762 In *Biloune v. Ghana*, the finding of indirect expropriation was based upon the arrest, detention and expulsion of Mr Biloune, who played a key role in the entire project.763 Moreover, the context was a joint venture between Mr Biloune\'s company and a company owned by the host State. In *Vivendi II*, the claimant held a concession from the government which it was forced to abandon.764 In *Tecmed v. Mexico*, the issue was the refusal to renew a permit based on what the tribunal described as "*a literal and strict interpretation of the conditions under which the Permit was granted*".765\n\n[*Metalclad v.

Norway had granted no permit to North Star. North Star had commenced operations at a time when Norway did not regulate the taking of snow crab in the Loop Hole. Its operations were carried out almost entirely in the Russian part of the Loop Hole and the Tribunal has held that North Star had no legitimate expectation that Norway would not in the future regulate the taking of snow crab on its outer continental shelf. In these circumstances, North Star\'s argument amounts to saying that if an investment is adversely affected by a change in the general regulatory regime then this may amount to an expropriation if the economic value of the investment is sufficiently badly affected. If that were the case, then the maker of sports cars whose business is seriously affected by the introduction or lowering of speed limits would be entitled to compensation on the basis that they had been the victims of indirect expropriation. If those business had been induced to invest by assurances given by the host State that such changes in the law would not be introduced, they might have a claim (though more likely for inequitable treatment than for expropriation). But in the present case, no such assurances were given.\n\n[]()\n\n565\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses the expropriation claim.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***f. Has Norway Violated the Duty of Most Favoured Nation Treatment***\n\n[]()\n\n566\\.\n\nArticle IV(1) of the BIT provides:\n\n*Most Favoured Nation Treatment*\n\n*1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State.*766\n\n**CL-0001**.\n\n[]()\n\n567\\.\n\nNorth Star argues that Norway permitted Russian vessels to harvest snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole even though it banned North Star\'s vessels from operating there.\n\n[]()\n\n568\\.\n\nThis allegation relates to a comparatively short period of time. During 2016, a temporary arrangement was in place between Norway and the Russian Federation under the terms of which each State permitted reciprocal access to its sector of the Loop Hole for snow crab vessels of the other State (see paragraph 92, above) pending the adoption of a management agreement. The arrangement came to an end at the end of 2016. Since there is no evidence that North Star\'s vessels took or attempted to take significant quantities of snow crab from the Norwegian sector until the *Senator* harvested crab there in late June 2016 (see paragraph 112, above), it is only in the second half of 2016 that the temporary arrangement between Norway and the Russian Federation could have had any effect for the purposes of the present case.\n\n[]()\n\n569\\.\n\nArticle IV of the BIT does not prohibit discrimination between Latvian investors and Russian investors. It prohibits discrimination between the *investment* of a Latvian investor and the *investment* of a Russian investor. Moreover, the effect of the definition provision in Article I(1) of the BIT is that both the Latvian investment and the Russian investment must be investments within the territory of Norway. The Tribunal has held that North Star\'s only investment in the territory of Norway was the claim to performance under the agreement with Seagourmet (see paragraphs 278 to 279, above). The question, therefore, is whether there was during 2016 a Russian investor\'s investment in Norway which was treated more favourably than North Star\'s investment.\n\n[]()\n\n570\\.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that that was the case. The Tribunal accepts that the Russian flagged vessels which harvested snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole during the second half of 2016 were owned by Russian companies but it does not consider that those vessels were an investment in Norway. The fact that a ship flagged in State A and owned by a company in State A operates for a few months taking snow crab on the continental shelf of State B does not amount to an investment by the State A company in the territory of State B. There is no long-term commitment and no apparent benefit to the economy of State B. In the present case, there is no indication of any benefit to the economy of Norway arising from the fact that those Russian vessels harvested snow crab from the Norwegian outer continental shelf.\n\n[]()\n\n571\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore dismisses the Article IV claim.\n\n[]()\n\n## **(4) The Svalbard Claims**\n\n[]()\n\n## ***a. Background***\n\n[]()\n\n572\\.\n\nThis part of the case turns on the Claimants\' argument that the ban on harvesting snow crab in the zone contravenes the terms of the Svalbard Treaty.\n\n[]()\n\n573\\.\n\nThat ban was introduced in the 2014 Regulations and, in effect, maintained in the 2015 Regulations—although the 2015 Regulations referred to the continental shelf rather than the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone, the effect was the same. At the time that North Star made its investment in Norway (as defined in Section IV above), it was not interested in harvesting snow crab in the waters around Svalbard but was focussed entirely on the Loop Hole. It was for that reason that it did not participate in the public consultations which preceded Norway\'s adoption of the 2014 Regulations.767\n\nCl. Reply, para. 146.\n\n[]()\n\n574\\.\n\nMoreover, at the time that North Star made its investment in Norway and began operations in the Loop Hole, it could not have claimed any right to harvest snow crab in the Svalbard FPZ. Latvia was not at that time a party to the Svalbard Treaty and could not have claimed any rights for its nationals under the terms of that Treaty.\n\n[]()\n\n575\\.\n\nThe Claimants\' interest in taking snow crab in the waters around Svalbard dates from the period after their vessels were excluded from harvesting snow crab in the Loop Hole. Following the adoption of the Russian ban in September 2016 and the arrest of the *Senator* in the same month on charges of having taken snow crab in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole, North Star ceased all operations in the Loop Hole. At that point it became interested in taking snow crab within 200 nautical miles of Svalbard.768 Latvia had become a party to the Svalbard Treaty in June 2016. In November 2016, Latvia issued licences for North Star\'s four ships to take snow crab in the waters around Svalbard.769\n\nPildegovics WS1, para. 207.\n\nThe licence for *Senator* was issued on 1 November 2016 and was valid to the end of 2016 (**C-0017**). Similar licences were issued by Latvia for the other three ships and for subsequent years. See also Pildegovics WS1, para. 87.\n\n[]()\n\n576\\.\n\nShortly before the *Senator* attempted to harvest snow crab on the continental shelf around Svalbard and was arrested on 16 January 2017, the technical director of North Star, Mr Andrey Kinzhalov, wrote to the Norwegian authorities in the following terms:\n\n*Our vessels are ready for their voyage to SVALBARD zone in order to catch Snow crab. Our vessels all have appropriate Certificates and Licenses.*\n\n*In order not to have any problems with the allowed area for catching we kindly ask you to inform us about the coordinates of conservancy areas where we have not the right to catch.*\n\n*Also please inform us – do we have the right to catch the snow crab less than 12 nautical miles from Svalbard and islands around Svalbard.*\n\n*Also please inform us what is the rules concerning informing of Coast Guard or any department on catching of crab*\\[…]770\n\n**R-0059**.\n\n[]()\n\n577\\.\n\nOn 15 January 2017, the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries replied:\n\n*Snow crab is a sedentary species under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This means that the Coastal State exercises sovereign rights over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources, including snow crab. This means that other States cannot harvest snow crab on the continental shelf of a coastal State, without the express consent of the coastal State concerned. According to UNCLOS, exploring and exploiting the natural resources of the continental shelf is a sovereign right vested with the coastal State. Under no circumstances may a State "license" the exploitation of living or non-living resources on the continental shelf of another State. Such illegal licensing would be a blatant violation of the coastal State\'s sovereign rights under international law. This includes licensing by the EU on behalf of vessels from EU member States. This has at several occasions been communicated to the EU, including in a verbal note from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the EU dated 9 January 2017. Hence the certificates and licenses your vessels are referring to in the letter are not in accordance with neither* \\[*sic*] *Norwegian nor international law.*\n\n*Harvesting of snow crab on the Norwegian continental shelf is prohibited unless an exemption has been granted. No such exemption has been granted to vessels flying the flag of an EU Member State. Therefore your vessels are not authorized to fish on the Norwegian continental shelf. This includes the whole Norwegian continental shelf, including the areas around Svalbard.*\n\n*Regulation no. 1836 of 19 December 2014, as amended by Regulation no. 1833 of 22 December 2015, prohibiting catches of snow crab is fully consistent with Norway\'s rights, jurisdiction and obligations as a coastal State under international law. The regulation also establishes the prohibition of harvesting snow crab within 12 nautical miles for all vessels that are granted exemption to harvest.*\n\n*Possible future harvesting of snow crab by vessels from EU member* \\[S]*tates on the Norwegian continental shelf, must be based on bilateral agreement. During the EU-Norway bilateral fisheries negotiations for 2017, Norway opened for snow crab being part of the quota exchange between Norway and the EU. However, the EU declined.*\n\n*Norway expects everyone to follow applicable regulations in Norwegian maritime areas, and we want to leave no doubt that such regulations will be enforced consistently as conveyed in the above mentioned note to the EU, and in accordance with international law.*\n\n*The Norwegian Coast Guard is prepared to enforce Norwegian law, and vessels starting fishing activity after snow crab without expressed consent from Norway will be arrested and prosecuted*.771\n\n**R-0060**.\n\n[]()\n\n578\\.\n\nThe *Senator* was arrested the following day (see paragraph 113, above)*.* The Norwegian courts, up to the level of the Supreme Court, upheld the penalties imposed on North Star and the captain of the *Senator* (see paragraphs 118 to 121, above).\n\n[]()\n\n## ***b. The Svalbard Treaty and the BIT***\n\n[]()\n\n579\\.\n\nAs the Tribunal has explained (see paragraph 78, above), the status of Svalbard (or Spitsbergen) is subject to the provisions of the Svalbard Treaty, 1920. Under Article 1 of the Treaty, the Contracting Parties "*undertake to recognise, subject to the stipulations of the present Treaty, the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over the Archipelago of Spitsbergen*".772\n\nSvalbard Treaty (**CL-0002**).\n\n[]()\n\n580\\.\n\nArticle 2 of the Svalbard Treaty provides in relevant part:\n\n*Ships and nationals of all the High Contracting Parties shall enjoy equally the rights of fishing and hunting in the territories specified in Article 1 and in their territorial waters.*\n\n[]()\n\n581\\.\n\nArticle 3 provides in relevant part:\n\n*The nationals of all the High Contracting Parties shall have equal liberty of access and entry for any reason or object whatever to the waters, fjords and ports of the territories specified in Article 1; subject to the observance of local laws and regulations, they may carry on there without impediment all maritime, industrial, mining and commercial operations on a footing of absolute equality. They shall be admitted under the same conditions of equality to the exercise and practise of all maritime, industrial, mining or commercial enterprises both on land and in the territorial waters, and no monopoly shall be established on any account for any enterprise whatever.*\n\n*Notwithstanding any rules relating to coasting trade which may be enforced in Norway, ships of the High Contracting Parties going to or coming from the territories specified in Article 1 shall have the right to put into Norwegian ports on their outward or homeward voyage for the purpose of taking on board or disembarking passengers or cargo going to or coming from the said territories, or for any other purpose.*\n\n*It is agreed that in every respect and especially with regard to exports, imports and transit traffic, the nationals of all the High Contracting Parties, their ships and goods shall not be subject to any charges or restrictions whatever which are not borne by the nationals, ships or goods which enjoy in Norway the treatment of the most favoured nation; Norwegian nationals, ships or goods being for this purpose assimilated to those of the other High Contracting Parties, and not treated more favourably in any respect.*\n\n[]()\n\n582\\.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Article 2 and Article 3 apply to the continental shelf of Svalbard and thus that, as Latvian nationals, they have an equal right to fish, including to take snow crab, in the Svalbard continental shelf. Norway\'s refusal to allow them to do so, they maintain, is contrary to Article 2 and therefore amounts to a violation of the BIT. Norway disputes this interpretation of Article 2, maintaining that it applies only to the territorial sea around Svalbard and not to the continental shelf, which did not exist as a legal concept in 1920.773\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Note Verbale from Norway to the EU, 8 February 2021 (**C-0176**).\n\n[]()\n\n583\\.\n\nNorway\'s view has long been contested by certain other parties to the Svalbard Treaty. The USSR and latterly the Russian Federation have maintained that the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 apply to the continental shelf around Svalbard.774 The same view has been expressed by Iceland,775 Spain776 and the United Kingdom,777 as well as by the EU.778\n\nNotes Verbale from the USSR to Norway, 15 June 1977 (**CL-0246**) and 14 June 1988 (**CL-0247**); from the Russian Federation to Norway, 17 July 1998 (**CL-0248**).\n\nNote Verbale from Iceland to Norway, 30 March 2006 (**CL-0249**).\n\nNote Verbale from Spain to Norway, 2 March 2007 (**C-0078**).\n\nNote Verbale from the United Kingdom to Norway, 11 March 2006 (as cited in M.

On a purely textual basis, the position taken by Norway cannot be dismissed out of hand but neither can the different interpretation advanced by other parties to the Treaty. Although the Claimants deny that they are asking the Tribunal to "*rule*" on the meaning of the Treaty provisions, in practice that is exactly what the Tribunal would have to do in order to determine whether in excluding North Star\'s vessels from the Svalbard continental shelf Norway acted contrary to its obligations under the Svalbard Treaty.\n\n[]()\n\n585\\.\n\nHowever, even if the Tribunal could make such a determination, that would not mean that Norway had acted in breach of the BIT. The Tribunal agrees with Norway that a breach of the Svalbard Treaty is not automatically a breach of the BIT. In the next section of this Award, therefore, the Tribunal will examine whether, assuming *arguendo* that the Claimants are correct in their interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty, Norway\'s actions amounted to a violation of the BIT.\n\n[]()\n\n## ***c. Did Norway Violate the BIT by Excluding North Star\'s Vessels from taking Snow Crab on the Svalbard Continental Shelf***\n\n[]()\n\n586\\.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, if Norway acted contrary to the Svalbard Treaty in excluding their vessels from taking snow crab on the Svalbard continental shelf, that action was also a violation of the obligation to admit their investment and to accord to their investment "*equitable and reasonable treatment*" under Article III of the BIT. They also maintain that Norway\'s actions with regard to access to Svalbard, taken together with Norway\'s earlier actions, amounted to expropriation contrary to Article VI. Finally, there is a separate allegation that the Claimants suffered a denial of justice.\n\n[]()\n\n587\\.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin with the argument that by refusing access to the continental shelf around Svalbard, Norway violated the obligation in Article III of the BIT to "*promote and encourage in its territory investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and accept such investments in accordance with its laws and regulations*". The Claimants argue that the refusal to allow them to access the continental shelf around Svalbard was a refusal to accept a new investment. That argument overlaps with the Loop Hole Claim in that North Star there makes the same argument in relation to denial of access to the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole.\n\n[]()\n\n588\\.\n\nThere are two difficulties with this argument. First, although Article III imposes a duty to accept a proposed investment, [Article IX](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/S2xraUxZV0x5VGNDd05TSWJIcXY1TXYvRjZZR1lYeG1nWHFoa3R6NWhmNVVpR2J6aDZNZy96ZWlQc210TGJFbkNxR2dXUkVjY2RFWXdjMXlwOU9Tb0daNlZDYVJBWjdoajlJV2I4eVp0aCtsSi9zdy9kZ2VkRTRxNitnYmxwRHc=) gives the Tribunal jurisdiction only with regard to a dispute concerning an existing investment.\n\n[]()\n\n589\\.\n\nSecondly, both with regard to a proposed investment in the Norwegian sector of the Loop Hole and with regard to a proposed investment in the continental shelf around Svalbard, the proposed investment would not have been in accordance with the laws and regulations of Norway.\n\n[]()\n\n590\\.\n\nInsofar as North Star sought in 2017 to make a fresh investment by taking snow crab in the Norwegian outer continental shelf in the Loop Hole at the time its vessels were excluded from the Russian sector of the Loop Hole, that proposed investment was contrary to Norwegian regulations which had been in force for several months prior to North Star seeking to make that fresh investment. Those regulations have been upheld by *the Supreme Court of Norway both in the criminal proceedings concerning the Senator779* and in the 2023 judgment in the civil proceedings.780\n\nSee para. 121, above.\n\nSee para. 122, above.\n\n[]()\n\n591\\.\n\nWith regard to the Svalbard element of the claim, the Norwegian regulations prohibiting foreign vessels from taking snow crab in the Svalbard continental shelf had been in force for even longer (since January 2015) and, crucially, since before Latvia acceded to the Svalbard Treaty.\n\n[]()\n\n592\\.\n\nNorth Star responds that the requirement that the proposed investment must be in accordance with Norwegian laws and regulations as they *should* be construed, which it takes to mean in accordance with its interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. The Norwegian Supreme Court has upheld the convictions in respect of the *Senator\'s* attempt to take snow crab in the Svalbard continental shelf. Moreover, in the 2023 civil judgment, the Supreme Court considered in some detail the argument now advanced by the Claimants regarding the interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty and unanimously rejected it. It is not open to an international tribunal to determine that a country\'s highest national court has misinterpreted and misapplied the law of that country. The Tribunal will return to this issue when it considers the denial of justice argument below.\n\n[]()\n\n593\\.\n\nThat leaves the question whether Norway\'s exclusion of North Star\'s vessels from the Svalbard continental shelf violated either Article III or Article IV of the BIT in relation to North Star\'s *existing* investment. The Tribunal has already held that that investment was confined to the claim to performance under the agreement that Seagourmet would buy from North Star snow crab landed in Båtsfjord by North Star so long as Seagourmet had the necessary capacity at its Båtsfjord plant.\n\n[]()\n\n594\\.\n\nThere is very little in the way of evidence of that agreement. The Tribunal has deduced its existence from the evidence of Mr Pildegovics and Mr Levanidov and from the pattern of deliveries by North Star to Seagourmet which began in 2015. At that time, the focus of North Star\'s activities was the Loop Hole. North Star did not participate in the consultation process which led to the adoption of the 2014 Regulations concerning the taking of snow crab in the Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone and the Norwegian Exclusive Economic Zone because it was not then interested in those waters. For the same reason, it did not apply for an exemption under the 2014 Regulations. Moreover, Latvia was not then a party to the Svalbard Treaty and North Star could not have invoked the Svalbard Treaty.\n\n[]()\n\n595\\.\n\nIn short, at the time that the investment came into existence, it had nothing to do with Svalbard and the continental shelf around it. There is no evidence that in 2015 North Star (or Mr Pildegovics) had any expectations regarding the possibility of taking snow crab on the Svalbard continental shelf or that the investment was made in reliance upon any such expectations. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot see that the refusal of Norway to permit North Star\'s vessels to take snow crab on the Svalbard continental shelf when North Star subsequently attempted to do so, violates Norway\'s Article III obligation to accord North Star\'s claim to performance under its earlier agreement with Seagourmet equitable and reasonable treatment.\n\n[]()\n\n596\\.\n\nThe written contracts between Seagourmet and North Star, concluded in late 2016 and 2017, which for the first time referred to the quantities of snow crab which North Star undertook to deliver and Seagourmet to purchase, do not alter this conclusion. By the time those written contracts were drafted, both of the parties to them knew that North Star\'s vessels would not be able to take snow crab in the Loop Hole and that Norwegian laws and regulations prohibited them from doing so in the Svalbard continental shelf. Unlike the earlier, unwritten agreement, these were essentially artificial instruments which neither party could have expected to implement.\n\n[]()\n\n597\\.\n\nThat leaves North Star\'s claim that it has been the victim of a denial of justice. There are two elements to this claim: first, that the process followed in the Norwegian courts amounted to a procedural denial of justice; and, secondly, that North Star suffered a substantive denial of justice when the Supreme Court refused to rule on its defence based on the Svalbard Treaty. The Tribunal has concluded that North Star has not made out either limb of this claim.\n\n[]()\n\n598\\.\n\nWith regard to procedural denial of justice, North Star\'s case is based an allegation that the appointment of Mr Stabell, the Deputy Attorney-General, as a prosecutor in the case was contrary to the principle that the prosecutor must be independent and demonstrated "*subservience to executive pressure*".781 The Tribunal does not accept that submission. North Star\'s argument is based first on what it conceives as the role of a prosecutor under Norwegian law. However, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Norwegian Supreme Court expressly considered this issue and ruled that Mr Stabell\'s presence as a co-prosecutor was not contrary to Norwegian law.782 The Tribunal must defer to that decision insofar as the issue is whether there was a breach of Norwegian law. To the extent that North Star argues that even if the appointment was consistent with Norwegian law, it was nevertheless a breach of international law, the Tribunal notes that North Star is unable to point to any provision in an applicable human rights treaty and relies on a report of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, which is clearly not applicable to Norway, and a report of a UN Special Rapporteur which deals in fairly general terms with the independence of a prosecutor and is, in any event, not binding.783\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 783.\n\nSee Memorandum on Appointment of Co-prosecutor for Supreme Court in Case No. 18-064307STR-HRET, 14 December 2018 (**R-0172**); *SIA North Star LTD v. Public Prosecuting Authority*, Supreme Court of Norway, Judgment, 9 January 2019 (**RL-0138**).\n\n*See* Cl. Reply, paras. 809-810, and the sources cited therein.\n\n[]()\n\n599\\.\n\nSo far as the claim of a substantive denial of justice is concerned, the Tribunal notes that the Norwegian Supreme Court in the criminal proceedings did not hold that North Star\'s argument based on the Svalbard Treaty was not justiciable in a Norwegian court but that it had to be advanced in civil proceedings and not as a defence in a criminal case. A State is entitled to determine the means by which a particular issue may be litigated before its courts. The Tribunal finds no denial of justice in the Supreme Court taking the view that it did. Nor does it accept that this approach led to unconscionable delay.\n\n[]()\n\n600\\.\n\nMoreover, North Star did pursue civil proceedings which culminated in the ruling of the Supreme Court in 2023 dismissing its claim and rejecting its interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty.784 There was, therefore, no refusal on the part of the Norwegian justice system to consider and rule upon North Star\'s claims. The Claimants have submitted two documents critical of the 2023 Supreme Court judgment.785 The first is an article by a Supreme Court justice who did not take part in the proceedings criticising the reasoning of the Court.786 While this article shows that there is a degree of controversy about the decision, the views of the justice who wrote it have to be set against the contrary views of the fifteen justices who took part in the judgment. The second is said to be a draft of a Note Verbale to be sent to Norway by the EU protesting the decision.787 There is no indication that such a Note was ever sent. Moreover, the text submitted to the Tribunal is headed with the following statement:\n\n*This document serves as a basis for discussion at the Working Party on Fisheries Policy. It cannot in any circumstances be regarded as the official position of the Commission. It is intended solely for those to whom it is addressed.*\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it cannot attach any weight to this document. Even if it could, however, the draft Note does no more than reiterate that the EU takes a different view of the Svalbard Treaty from the Norwegian Government and the Supreme Court. For the reasons already given the Tribunal cannot rule on that difference. Neither the EU draft nor the article by Justice Skoghøy afford any support to the Claimants\' argument that they suffered a denial of justice.\n\n*SIA North Star Ltd. v. The State of Norway, represented by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries*, HR-2023-491-P, Case No. 22-134375SIV-HRET, Judgment of 20 March 2023 (**C-0358)**; see paragraph 122, above.\n\nSee paragraph 123, above.\n\n*Interpretation of the Wording of Treaties – Commentary on the Snakrab Judgment*, 23 March 2023 (**C-0359**).\n\nDraft EU Note Verbale to the Kingdom of Norway, 2 October 2023 (**C-0357**).\n\n[]()\n\n601\\.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Article III part of the Svalbard claims.\n\n[]()\n\n602\\.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider that there has been a breach of Article VI. It has already held that Norway\'s actions during 2015 and 2016 did not amount to an expropriation of North Star\'s investment. The fact that Norway subsequently prevented North Star from taking snow crab in the Svalbard continental shelf does not raise Norway\'s actions to the level of an expropriation of that investment. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Article VI claim.\n\n[]()\n\n## **(5) Sea &amp; Coast**\n\n[]()\n\n603\\.\n\nThe Tribunal turns briefly to the First Claimant\'s case that he has suffered a violation of the BIT based on his ownership of 100% of the shares in Sea &amp; Coast. He acquired those shares in 2015. It is common ground between the Parties that they constitute an investment by Mr Pildegovics in Norway within the meaning of the BIT.788\n\nSee paragraph 160, above.\n\n[]()\n\n604\\.\n\nMr Pildegovics maintains that his shareholding in Sea &amp; Coast was the subject of multiple violations of the BIT. However, this claim was scarcely developed in the Memorial and not mentioned in the Reply. Nor does the expert report on valuation submitted by the Claimants contain any assessment of the value of the damage allegedly sustained by Sea &amp; Coast. That led Norway to argue that there is in fact no separate claim in respect of Sea &amp; Coast.789 The Tribunal expressly raised that issue at the Hearing.790 In response, the First Claimant stated:\n\n*The answer to this question is yes, there is a distinct claim in respect of the alleged damage to Sea &amp; Coast or rather to Mr Pildegovics\' investment in Sea &amp; Coast. That claim exists because Mr Pildegovics\' shares in Sea &amp; Coast, which are part of the investment, have lost value due to Norway\'s breaches of the BIT.*\n\n*That loss of value is distinct from the loss suffered by North Star, because Sea &amp; Coast and North Star are two different businesses with different business models.*\n\n*However, the claim related to Sea &amp; Coast has not yet been quantified, it would have required its own expert report, because these are different businesses, calling for different analyses, but the Claimants reserve the right to do so in a subsequent phase of this arbitration if needed*.791\n\nRes.

In addition, [ICSID Arbitration Rule 31(3)](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/V0JyUlJFRDBRNmdVZmxOOVNneG1rK09yUXE5bkptR0FmTjNNeVo4OGdBRHdkRTlRYnIvNUx1eFN1WCtWaWFoc2N3WGVxRjJOUmkzM1ZsVGNmWE9wb1kyamF5RWZuS0tJdER5TEQ4SlZYYTA9) requires that the Memorial shall contain "*a statement of the relevant facts; a statement of law; and the submissions*". In the case of the First Claimant\'s claim regarding Sea &amp; Coast, it is difficult to see how these requirements can be considered to have been met. Nevertheless, Norway did not raise an objection on these grounds and the Tribunal will consider the claim as advanced at the Hearing.\n\n[]()\n\n606\\.\n\nThe Memorial describes the activities of Sea &amp; Coast in the following terms:\n\n*Since June 2014, Sea &amp; Coast operated as a service agent for North Star, its vessels and its crews. Its mission was to procure goods and services needed for the operation of North Star\'s vessels, notably by building commercial relationships with suppliers from the local community*.792\n\nCl. Mem. Para. 248.\n\n[]()\n\n607\\.\n\nMr Pildegovics alleges that Sea &amp; Coast had operating revenues of NOK 19.3 million in 2015 and NOK 18.5 million in. 2016.793 Of these revenues, however, only NOK 1.7 million in 2015 and NOK 2.7 million in 2016 appear to have come from North Star.794 In his testimony at the Hearing, Mr Pildegovics admitted that the majority of Sea &amp; Coast\'s revenues came from clients other than North Star.795\n\nCl. Mem. Para. 251; Pildegovics WS1, para. 168; Sea &amp; Coast Annual Reports for 2014 (**PP-0215**), 2015 (**PP-0216**) and 2016 (**PP-0217**).\n\nPildegovics WS1, para. 167.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 70, lines 8-18.\n\n[]()\n\n608\\.\n\nMr Pildegovics was asked a number of questions about the clients, other than North Star, which Sea &amp; Coast had and about the claim in respect of Sea &amp; Coast. His initial comment was:\n\n\\[T]*here were lots of Russian vessels coming to Båtsfjord for unloadings. and some of the Russian companies came to us and asked if we can help them as well to organise the same things which we organised for North Star*.796\n\nLater, there were the following exchanges:\n\n*Q. Is it your case that Norway in any way impeded Sea &amp; Coast\'s ability to act as an agent for the vessels of North Star and any other company?*\n\n*A. The actions of Norway definitely led to the drop, a sharp drop of revenues of that company, due to the fact that vessels which were serviced by that company were not able to continue fishery.*\n\n*Q. Does that include Russian vessels as well as the North Star vessels ?*\n\n*A. Well, primarily we are talking about European vessels which were stopped starting from September*.797\n\n\\[…]\n\n\\[…] *Sea &amp; Coast lost not only North Star as a client but lost all other crab fishing companies, which were not able to continue fishing due to actions of Norway*. *I think this is important, because since that happened, Sea &amp; Coast lost all clients, not only North Star, but all*.798\n\nFinally, in re-examination, there was the following exchange:\n\n*Q.* \\[…] *in addition to North Star, who were the other clients of Sea &amp; Coast ?*\n\n*A. Just before September 2016 the client was the Lithuanian company who was catching with three vessels in the Barents Sea, and as I said, there were a couple of Russian companies who were also catching snow crab*.799\n\nTrabnscript, Day 2, p. 70, lines 15-18.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 71, lines 11-21.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 147, lines 8-13.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 154, lines 18-23.\n\n[]()\n\n609\\.\n\nThe Annual Reports for 2015 and 2016 show that the company made a loss (NOK 118,602 in 2015 and NOK 1,240,661 in 2016) in both years. Thereafter there was a marked decline in the company\'s results with revenue of only NOK 3.1 million and a loss of NOK 3.61 million in 2017.800\n\nAnnual report 2017 (**PP-0218**).\n\n[]()\n\n610\\.\n\nSince the present proceedings were bifurcated (see paragraph 28, above) the First Claimant cannot be criticised for not having set out the extent of the damages which he claims to have suffered. However, the question of liability has to be determined in the present phase of the proceedings. It follows that the existence of a breach, or breaches, of the BIT has to be established at this stage. The Tribunal considers that the First Claimant has failed to establish the existence of any such breach.\n\n[]()\n\n611\\.\n\nThe essence of the claim relating to Sea &amp; Coast appears to be that once North Star\'s fleet and other EU, and perhaps Russian, crabbers were obliged to cease operating in the Loop Hole and continued to be barred from taking snow crab around Svalbard, Sea &amp; Coast\'s business of servicing these vessels suffered a severe decline.\n\n[]()\n\n612\\.\n\nNorway was not, however, under any obligation to ensure that there was a market for Sea &amp; Coast\'s services. To the extent that Sea &amp; Coast\'s business decline was due to the disappearance of work from North Star, the Tribunal considers that there could be no claim under the BIT in respect of Sea &amp; Coast unless, at the very least, Norway had acted unlawfully in the steps which it took that affected North Star\'s business. The Tribunal has held that there was no such illegality in Norway\'s treatment of North Star.\n\n[]()\n\n613\\.\n\nTo the extent that the Sea &amp; Coast claim is based on the loss of work from other clients, the Tribunal has been provided with no information about those clients or how acts attributable to Norway affected their demand for the services of Sea &amp; Coast.\n\n[]()\n\n614\\.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that there is nothing in the record on which a finding of a breach of the BIT with regard to Sea &amp; Coast could possibly be based and dismisses the First Claimant\'s claim in respect of his shareholding in that company.\n\n[]()\n\n## **(6) Conclusion**\n\n[]()\n\n615\\.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimants\' claims should be dismissed in their entirety.\n\n[]()\n\n## **VI. COSTS**\n\n[]()\n\n616\\.\n\n[Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/S2VVN09EOGhRRHg0SlZ3SS9qUjlwSUhxOWpSbTk0ZGxsOTFuVUV3TlRXRzdrWGQyOWVoOUU0WjNBM2sxaGo0NWZ1RWpXU01heVNtdmxZZGJZRnc1dFJFMHlTYlBrTzFZbHFsK1Q5aHljTlowZUFWeHp6d1NxU0JqVXlid0dDQUo2TFlxOXJvenRhU1lvRHdFSXdtclVZdWozWS81bXZUL2JnelpFa0krdzRFRjBOUmZiRzFmb2h4d0NjWVdyN2lmejIwdEViUGRSSTY3c0JBMWRCNGExNGZ5T0p4MnVNYUdoeHE5SjNub3ZzST0=) provides that:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n[]()\n\n617\\.\n\nUnlike the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules contain a presumption in favour of an award of costs to the successful Party. The Tribunal thus has a discretion regarding whether to make an award of costs and, if so, on what terms. Costs fall into two distinct categories: the costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, and the costs incurred by the Parties for their legal representation, for retaining the services of experts and for incidental expenses ("**Costs of Representation**").\n\n[]()\n\n618\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is only just that the unsuccessful Party should meet the entire costs of the arbitration. In the present case, those costs are as follows:\n\nICSID\'s administrative fees: USD 168,000.00 Direct Expenses: USD 111,323.15\n\nFees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal:\n\nSir Christopher Greenwood: USD 131,857.04 The Hon. L. Yves Fortier: USD 111,076.12 Professor Donald McRae: USD 75,050.73 **Total:** **USD 597,307.04**\n\n[]()\n\n619\\.\n\nThese costs have been met by advance payments made on an equal basis by the Parties.801\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account. The outstanding balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the advance payments that they have made to ICSID.\n\n[]()\n\n620\\.\n\nThe Tribunal directs that the Claimants pay to the Respondent the sum of **USD 597,307.04** to cover the entirety of the arbitration costs. Each Claimant shall be jointly and severally liable for the entirety of this sum.\n\n[]()\n\n621\\.\n\nSo far as the Costs of Representation are concerned, the Tribunal considers that, since Norway has been successful in the proceeding, the Claimants should pay to the Respondent at least some part of the latter\'s reasonable costs of representation and legal expenses.\n\n[]()\n\n622\\.\n\nThe Respondent\'s costs of representation are as follows:802\n\nCosts of representation by Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials: EUR 395,259.76 Costs of representation by external counsel: EUR 1,105,800.00 Expenses: EUR 118,388.38 **Total:** **EUR 1,619,448.14**\n\nResp. Statement of Costs, 2 December 2022. Costs are itemised in detail in the attachments. The total amount claimed by Norway was EUR 1,882,505.85 but that figure included EUR 263,057.71 in respect of Norway\'s advance payments to ICSID which are dealt with separately in this Award (see paragraph 620, above). That left a total of EUR 1,619,448.14 of which the figure given in paragraph 625 represents half.\n\n[]()\n\n623\\.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these costs and expenses are reasonable. In reaching that assessment, it has taken account of the length and complexity of the proceedings and the fact that the amount claimed by the Respondent in respect of Costs of Representation, both by officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and external counsel, is considerably less than that set out in the Preliminary Statement of Costs submitted by the Claimants. While the Claimants inform the Tribunal that "*counsel is engaged on a mixed fee agreement (ie with a success fee component)*" so that "*it is difficult, especially at this stage, for Claimants to identify with precision costs \'incurred or borne\' under the terms of [Article 28(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules](https://jusmundi.com/en/document/h/V0JyUlJFRDBRNmdVZmxOOVNneG1rK09yUXE5bkptR0FmTjNNeVo4OGdBRHdkRTlRYnIvNUx1eFN1WCtWaWFoc2N3WGVxRjJOUmkzM1ZsVGNmWE9wb1JacGlqUjdnZnZyWU8zdUZUeE9Xbkk9)*".803 Nevertheless, the estimate of costs of legal representation submitted by the Claimants is significantly higher than the costs claimed for legal representation by the Respondent, while the figure for expenses (excluding the costs of expert witnesses) is comparable to that of the Respondent.\n\nLetter from counsel for the Claimants to the Tribunal, 2 December 2022.\n\n[]()\n\n624\\.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that it should also take into account that the Respondent raised a number of objections to jurisdiction and admissibility which were either wholly unsuccessful or successful only in part. For that reason, it has concluded that the Claimants should be required to meet only one half of the Respondent\'s costs of representation.\n\n[]()\n\n625\\.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants shall reimburse the Respondent a total of **EUR 809,724.07** in respect of the Costs of Representation incurred. Each Claimant shall be jointly and severally liable for the entirety of this sum.\n\n[]()\n\n## **VII.
